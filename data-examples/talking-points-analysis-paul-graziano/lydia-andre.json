        "chain_of_thought": "Let's analyze the testimony step by step and compare it to the reference talking points:\n\n1. The testimony mentions \"trickle down supply side concept doesn't work,\" which doesn't directly align with any specific reference talking point.\n\n2. The speaker questions why affordable housing isn't being mandated, which isn't directly addressed in the reference points.\n\n3. The testimony expresses concern about removing local control, which aligns with the reference point about \"Loss of local control over development.\"\n\n4. The speaker mentions preserving neighborhood character, which aligns with the reference point \"The proposals would dramatically change neighborhood character.\"\n\n5. The testimony criticizes the market's ability to create affordable housing, which doesn't directly align with any reference point.\n\n6. The speaker mentions the importance of open space, which loosely relates to the \"Environmental and infrastructure concerns\" point.\n\n7. The testimony questions the use of AMI numbers and income averaging, which isn't directly addressed in the reference points.\n\n8. The speaker doesn't mention population decline, parking requirements, or specific zoning changes, which are prominent in the reference talking points.\n\nOverall, while there are some alignments, the testimony doesn't closely follow the reference talking points. It focuses more on affordable housing concerns and local control, touching on only a few of the reference points.",
