The testimony does not directly mention neighborhood character changes or specific zoning issues.\n2. There's no mention of population decline or existing zoning capacity.\n3. The testimony does criticize developers and the real estate industry, which aligns with the reference point about proposals favoring developers.\n4. There's no specific mention of low-density neighborhoods or single-family homes.\n5. The testimony doesn't directly address loss of local control, but it does mention \"stacking developer friendly people on the community boards,\" which could be related.\n6. Environmental and infrastructure concerns are not specifically addressed.\n7. The testimony does criticize the rushed nature of the process, which somewhat aligns with the questionable public engagement point.\n\nOverall, while there are some alignments, particularly regarding criticism of developers and rushed processes, many of the specific talking points are not directly addressed in the testimony.",

However, it lacks the specific details and arguments present in many of the reference talking points. The testimony focuses more on general concerns about housing, homelessness, and wealth disparity, rather than addressing specific zoning or neighborhood character issues. While there is some alignment in the overall sentiment of opposition to the proposed changes, the testimony does not closely mirror the language or specific arguments of the reference talking points.",
