            "Housing scarcity degrades New Yorkers' quality of life and is bad for the city's economy and fiscal health",
            "Negative out-migration caused by housing affordability and availability crises cost the city over $300 million in tax revenue in 2022",
            "Allowing growth could potentially boost city tax receipts by over $2 billion a year",
            "In CBC's 2023 resident survey, housing ranked among the top issues facing New Yorkers, with fewer than 1 in 10 feeling that government is addressing their housing needs well",
            "Building more housing will improve affordability, quality of life, strengthen the city's economy and competitiveness",
            "The final zoning text needs to result in a meaningful increase in development capacity citywide to improve affordability and quality of life",

        "chain_of_thought": "To analyze the similarity between the testimony and the reference talking points, I'll go through the testimony and compare it to the key points in the reference:\n\n1. The testimony strongly supports the \"City of Yes\" proposal, which aligns with the overall sentiment of the reference talking points.\n\n2. The testimony focuses on the need to build more housing everywhere, which indirectly supports the idea of reducing parking mandates to allow for more housing construction.\n\n3. The testimony mentions that current policies have slowed new construction, which aligns with the reference point about outdated parking minimum rules.\n\n4. The testimony discusses the economic and fiscal impacts of the housing shortage, which is not directly mentioned in the reference talking points.\n\n5. The testimony doesn't specifically mention parking mandates or their impact on housing costs, which is a significant focus of the reference talking points.\n\n6. The testimony emphasizes the citywide nature of the housing problem, which aligns with the reference points about comprehensive reform.\n\n7. There's no mention in the testimony about climate change, transportation emissions, or car dependence, which are key points in the reference talking points.\n\n8. The testimony doesn't discuss the specific benefits of reducing parking mandates, such as improved walkability or street life, which are mentioned in the reference points.\n\nOverall, while the testimony supports the \"City of Yes\" proposal and emphasizes the need for more housing, it doesn't directly address many of the specific points about parking mandates that are central to the reference talking points.",

        ],
        "analysis": "The testimony is generally supportive of the \"City of Yes\" proposal and emphasizes the need for increased housing production across New York City. This aligns with the overall goal of the reference talking points, which is to promote policies that would increase housing availability and affordability.\n\nHowever, the testimony focuses primarily on the broad economic and fiscal impacts of the housing shortage, rather than on the specific issue of parking mandates, which is the central theme of the reference talking points. The testimony does not mention parking requirements, their impact on housing costs, or their relationship to transportation and climate change.\n\nWhile both the testimony and the reference talking points advocate for citywide policy changes to address the housing crisis, they approach the issue from different angles. The testimony emphasizes the economic benefits of increased housing production, while the reference talking points focus on the specific benefits of reducing parking mandates.\n\nThe testimony could be seen as indirectly supporting some of the goals mentioned in the reference talking points, such as increasing housing affordability and availability. However, it does not explicitly endorse or mention the specific policy of reducing parking mandates, which is the core focus of the reference talking points.",
