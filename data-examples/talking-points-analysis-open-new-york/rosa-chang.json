        "chain_of_thought": "Let's analyze the testimony step by step:\n\n1. The speaker, Rosa Chang, expresses support for the City of Yes proposal with certain conditions.\n2. She mentions the need for building homes for various groups of New Yorkers, which aligns with the general sentiment of the reference talking points.\n3. Rosa emphasizes the need for infrastructure improvements to keep up with increased density, which is not directly addressed in the reference talking points.\n4. She suggests a 5-year sunset provision for offsetting affordable housing, which relates to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, but with a different approach.\n5. Rosa supports eliminating or reducing the 680 square foot dwelling unit factor, which aligns with the Shared Housing (SRO) talking point.\n6. She mentions living in smaller units (250-550 sq ft) for many years, further supporting the Shared Housing concept.\n7. Rosa expresses concern about the proposal not doing enough to create truly affordable housing, which partially aligns with the UAP talking point.\n8. There is no mention of parking minimums, transit-oriented development, town center zoning, ADUs, or office-to-residential conversions in Rosa's testimony.\n\nOverall, while Rosa supports the City of Yes proposal, her testimony focuses more on infrastructure needs and affordable housing concerns than on the specific talking points provided in the reference.",
