            "The cost to construct affordable housing has increased drastically",

        "chain_of_thought": "Let's analyze the testimony step by step:\n\n1. The speaker, Amie Gross, is an architect specializing in affordable and supportive housing.\n2. She emphasizes the need for affordable housing and the increasing costs of construction.\n3. The main point she makes is that building larger buildings (more units) can help reduce the cost per unit, making housing more affordable.\n4. She mentions that changing the scale of buildings is part of the solution, which aligns with the City of Yes proposal.\n5. Gross discusses how certain regulations, while necessary, increase costs, and these costs can be better absorbed by larger projects.\n6. She argues that building larger buildings in the same zoning lot can lead to economies of scale, resulting in lower rents.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the reference talking points:\n\n1. The testimony aligns closely with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, which mentions allowing extra floor area for affordable housing.\n2. The speaker's emphasis on the need for more affordable housing and the benefits of larger buildings aligns with the UAP's point about denser buildings being worth it for new affordable housing.\n3. While the testimony doesn't directly mention parking minimums, transit-oriented development, or other specific points, it does support the general idea of allowing larger and denser buildings to create more affordable housing.\n4. The testimony doesn't contradict any of the reference talking points and generally supports the idea of zoning changes to facilitate more affordable housing construction.",

        ],
        "analysis": "The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP). While it doesn't cover all the points mentioned in the reference talking points, it strongly supports the core idea of allowing larger, denser buildings to create more affordable housing. The speaker, an architect specializing in affordable housing, provides professional insight into how zoning changes allowing for larger buildings can lead to more cost-effective and affordable housing construction. This aligns well with the UAP's emphasis on extra floor area for affordable housing and the benefits of slightly denser buildings. The testimony doesn't contradict any of the reference talking points and provides additional economic reasoning to support the proposed changes.",
