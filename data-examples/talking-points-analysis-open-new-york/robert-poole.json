        "chain_of_thought": "Let's analyze the testimony step by step:\n\n1. The speaker, Robert Poole, represents Bronx Pro Group, an affordable housing developer.\n2. He expresses strong support for the City of Yes zoning reform legislation.\n3. He emphasizes the dire need for affordable housing, citing 67,000 applicants for just 67 lottery units in one of their projects.\n4. He mentions the need for every district to address the housing affordability crisis, not just certain areas.\n5. He shares his personal experience of living in various types of housing in NYC, including what he calls a \"modern day SRO\" with multiple roommates.\n6. He expresses concern about raising a family in the city and the need for more housing choices.\n7. He concludes by urging support for the legislation to alleviate the housing crunch and provide more options for people moving to or living in the city.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the reference talking points:\n\n1. The testimony strongly aligns with the overall message of the need for more affordable housing options, which is a central theme in the reference talking points.\n2. While the speaker doesn't explicitly mention Universal Affordability Preference (UAP), his focus on affordable housing development aligns with this point.\n3. The testimony doesn't directly mention lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, or \"Town Center\" zoning.\n4. The speaker's personal experience of living in a \"modern day SRO\" with multiple roommates relates to the \"Shared Housing\" talking point, though he doesn't explicitly advocate for legalizing SROs.\n5. The testimony doesn't mention office-to-residential conversions or Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs).\n\nOverall, while the testimony doesn't use the exact language or cover all the specific points in the reference talking points, it strongly supports the general idea of zoning reform to increase affordable housing options, which is a central theme in the talking points.",
