While it doesn't cover all the points mentioned in the reference list, it strongly supports the zoning text amendment and focuses on aspects that align with some of the key talking points, particularly those related to Transit-Oriented Development and the Universal Affordability Preference. The testimony emphasizes the creation of affordable housing and the benefits of additional floor area ratio near transit, which are themes present in the reference talking points. However, the testimony is more focused on the specific concerns of rent-stabilized housing providers and doesn't touch on many of the other points mentioned in the reference list, such as parking minimums, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing.",
