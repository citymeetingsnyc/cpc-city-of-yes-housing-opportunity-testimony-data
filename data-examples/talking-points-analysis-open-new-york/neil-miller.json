He mentions his grandparents finding affordable housing in NYC, relating it to the current housing crisis.\n3. He specifically supports the UAP (Universal Affordability Preference) provision, mentioning the 260% AMI affordability level.\n4. He supports office conversions, mentioning the state budget incentives and affordability requirements.\n5. He mentions support for town center and EDU proposals to add homes across the city.\n6. He briefly touches on congestion reduction and public transit use.\n7. He supports changes to allow more building types, specifically mentioning courtyards.\n\nNow, let's compare these points to the reference talking points:\n\n1. UAP: The testimony directly supports this, mentioning specifics like the 260% AMI level.\n2. Parking Minimums: Not explicitly mentioned in the testimony.\n3. Transit-Oriented Development: While not explicitly mentioned, the speaker supports adding homes across the city and mentions congestion reduction through public transit use.\n4. Town Center Zoning: Directly mentioned and supported in the testimony.\n5. ADUs: Not mentioned in the testimony.\n6. Office-to-Residential: Directly supported in the testimony, with mention of state budget incentives.\n7. Shared Housing (SROs): Not mentioned in the testimony.\n\nThe testimony aligns closely with several key talking points, particularly UAP, Town Center Zoning, and Office-to-Residential conversions. While not all points are covered, the ones mentioned are strongly supported and use similar language to the reference talking points.",
