        "chain_of_thought": "Let's analyze the testimony step by step:\n\n1. The speaker, Sean Campion, supports the \"City of Yes\" proposal.\n2. He emphasizes the need to build more housing everywhere, of all types, for everyone.\n3. He mentions that housing production has failed to keep pace with demand due to restrictive policies.\n4. He highlights the negative fiscal and economic impacts of under-production of housing.\n5. He discusses the dissatisfaction of New Yorkers with the current housing situation.\n6. He advocates for building more housing of every type in every neighborhood.\n7. He warns against scaling back the scope of the proposal or exempting certain neighborhoods.\n8. He emphasizes that the housing crisis is a citywide problem that demands a citywide response.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the reference talking points:\n\n1. The testimony aligns with the overall theme of the talking points, which is to increase housing production across the city.\n2. The testimony doesn't specifically mention the Universal Affordability Preference, but it does support building more affordable housing.\n3. The testimony doesn't directly address lifting parking minimums or Transit-Oriented Development.\n4. The testimony's emphasis on building in every neighborhood aligns with the \"Town Center\" zoning concept.\n5. The testimony doesn't specifically mention ADUs, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing.\n6. The testimony's focus on citywide solutions and warning against exempting neighborhoods aligns with the overall spirit of the talking points.\n\nWhile the testimony doesn't explicitly use the same language as the talking points, it strongly supports the general principle of increasing housing production across the city, which is a core theme of the talking points.",

The speaker emphasizes the need for more housing of all types in every neighborhood, which is consistent with the broad goals outlined in the talking points.\n\nHowever, the testimony does not specifically mention or directly address many of the particular policy proposals outlined in the talking points, such as the Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, ADUs, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing. Instead, it focuses on the general need for increased housing production and the negative consequences of the current housing shortage.\n\nThe testimony does strongly support the idea of citywide action and warns against exempting certain neighborhoods, which aligns with the spirit of the talking points. It also emphasizes the economic and fiscal benefits of increasing housing production, which, while not directly mentioned in the talking points, supports the overall goal of increasing housing supply.\n\nWhile the testimony doesn't use the same specific language or examples as the talking points, it does support the same general approach and goals. Therefore, it can be classified as supporting the talking points, even though it doesn't make the exact same claims or use very similar language.",
