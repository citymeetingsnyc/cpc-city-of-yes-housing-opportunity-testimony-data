        "chain_of_thought": "To analyze the testimony in relation to the reference talking points, I'll go through the main points made in the testimony and compare them to the provided talking points:\n\n1. The testimony strongly supports the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) provision, which aligns with the first talking point.\n2. The speaker emphasizes the need for more market-rate housing, which is not directly mentioned in the talking points but supports the overall goal of increasing housing supply.\n3. The testimony highlights the low vacancy rates and low housing production in NYC compared to other cities, which indirectly supports many of the talking points about increasing housing supply.\n4. The speaker advocates for changing zoning rules to allow more housing production, which aligns with several talking points, especially Transit-Oriented Development and \"Town Center\" Zoning.\n5. The testimony mentions allowing ADUs, which directly relates to the Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) talking point.\n6. The overall message of the testimony is that more housing of all types is needed in every neighborhood, which aligns with the general theme of the talking points.\n\nWhile the testimony doesn't cover all the specific points mentioned in the reference talking points, it strongly supports the overall message and several key points.",
