      "The proposal will not alleviate affordable housing shortage or make neighborhoods more environmentally friendly",
      "It will exacerbate overtaxed and overburdened aging drainage, sewage, and sanitation systems",
      "Construction of big apartment buildings without parking requirements will lead to more congestion",
      "Mass transit should be fixed to discourage driving, not removing parking",
      "The proposal targets low-density neighborhoods like Regal Park, which already faced issues during the pandemic and recent storms",
      "Safety concerns about legalizing basement apartments and accessory dwelling units",
      "The proposal takes away local communities' voices",
      "It favors real estate developers' interests",
      "Infrastructure should be addressed with a site-specific approach, not a one-size-fits-all solution"
