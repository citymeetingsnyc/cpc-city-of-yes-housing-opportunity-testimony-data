      "City of Yes will discourage development in areas with vacant and underbuilt sites",
      "The initiative will encourage luxury housing development in already built-up areas",
      "Boosting supply hasn't lowered housing costs in other cities like Vancouver",
      "Areas in New York with the most new housing have seen housing costs rise, not fall",
      "The plan may lead to a loss of existing affordable housing",
      "Development rights transfers may incentivize tearing down affordable apartment buildings",
      "New luxury buildings may include fewer units than the buildings they replace",
      "The market seems incapable of producing anything but luxury units in cities with high real estate investment value",
      "Suggests studying alternatives like Vienna's social housing and Westchester's affordability mandates",
      "Criticizes the lack of consultation with zoning experts like George Gaines",
      "Argues that City of Yes is a gift to real estate executives packaged as an affordable housing initiative",
      "Believes the plan may increase housing costs rather than decrease them"
