      "Community Board 13 unanimously adopted a resolution recommending rejection of City of Yes for Housing Opportunity",
      "The proposal would remove traditional community board, borough president, and city council review of uses not permitted under existing zoning",
      "Charter-mandated community review protects neighborhoods from adverse impacts",
      "The city should provide tools and resources to community boards to identify appropriate parcels for beneficial local development",
      "The 'as of right' features would weaken or render useless the Charter-mandated community review provisions",
      "Suggests implementing tools through a community review process on a case-by-case basis instead of citywide",
      "Advocates for community-based collaborations for affordable housing and senior housing, similar to Long Island's smart growth initiatives"
