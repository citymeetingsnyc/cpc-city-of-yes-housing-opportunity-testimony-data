      "City of Yes takes the right approach to New York City's housing crisis by proposing to build more housing everywhere of all types for everyone",
      "Housing production in NYC has failed to keep pace with demand due to policy actions intended to slow new construction",
      "Housing scarcity degrades New Yorkers' quality of life and is bad for the city's economy and fiscal health",
      "Negative out-migration caused by housing affordability and availability crises cost the city over $300 million in tax revenue in 2022",
      "Allowing growth could potentially boost city tax receipts by over $2 billion a year",
      "In CBC's 2023 resident survey, housing ranked among the top issues facing New Yorkers, with fewer than 1 in 10 feeling that government is addressing their housing needs well",
      "Building more housing will improve affordability, quality of life, strengthen the city's economy and competitiveness",
      "The final zoning text needs to result in a meaningful increase in development capacity citywide to improve affordability and quality of life",
