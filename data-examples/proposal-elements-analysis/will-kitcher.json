This aligns with the proposal's aim to make it easier for non-residential spaces to be converted into housing."

          "reasoning": "The speaker explicitly supports repealing parking mandates, which directly aligns with the proposal's aim to remove parking requirements for new housing developments.

          "reasoning": "This quote describes a situation where people were living in a converted garage space behind a home, which is essentially an example of an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). The speaker's uncertainty about its legality and the mention of its usefulness for people in the neighborhood aligns with the proposal's aim to legalize and promote ADUs."

The speaker suggests that this proximity to public transit would reduce the need for vehicles, which aligns with the proposal's goal of promoting development near public transportation to support convenient lifestyles and reduce car dependency."
