When when that that's only an option in one small portion. And in Staten Island, it only seems to the proposal is only to apply that potentially in one tiny small little area. So that this is not affordable housing at all.",
          "reasoning": "The speaker is referring to the affordable housing component of the proposal, which is a key aspect of the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP). Although he's criticizing its limited application, this shows he's aware of and discussing this element of the proposal."

One reason is any basement that has plumbing typically floods when when it rains heavily. And this proposal would require that if people live in a basement, that would require that they put plumbing in there. So that would create a very omnous situation.",
