      "City Island is a unique, low-density residential community with special district zoning",
      "The proposal is a blanket zoning change that will eliminate community voices",

      "The community attracts visitors for its quaint, nautical village atmosphere",
      "Concerns about increased density and lack of parking affecting local businesses",
      "Climate change and flood risks need to be addressed before increasing density",
      "Urges a common-sense approach to zoning that considers each community's uniqueness",
      "Suggests focusing on homeownership and single/two-family homes for more housing"
