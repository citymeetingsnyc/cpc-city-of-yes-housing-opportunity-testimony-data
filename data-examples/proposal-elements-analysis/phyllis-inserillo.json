      "Howard Beach says no to overcrowded classrooms, longer waits for infrastructure fixes, and housing units on top of stores",
      "The community needs more police officers, EMS workers, firefighters, and better laws to protect families",
      "Better infrastructure for sewers and utilities, and solutions to flooding issues are needed",
      "Homeowners are burdened with high property taxes and mortgages",
      "12 out of 14 community boards in Queens have voted against this plan"
