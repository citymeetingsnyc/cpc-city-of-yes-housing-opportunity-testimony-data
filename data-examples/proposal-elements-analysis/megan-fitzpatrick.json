      "The plan will increase market-rate development in already dense residential areas",
      "It may create substandard and unsustainable housing",
      "The proposal could accelerate gentrification",
      "It may negatively impact quality of life due to increased traffic and density",
      "The plan excludes public and City Council input from land use decisions",
      "It loosens landmark transfer development rights, potentially allowing taller market-rate buildings",
