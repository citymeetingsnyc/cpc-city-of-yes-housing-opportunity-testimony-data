rent the rent is so damn high as Jimmy McMillan says anybody know this no we've lost a million plus rent stabilized apartments in the city of New York in the last 25 years and they want to replace that million rent stabilized apartments by tearing down our homes okay they created the pro the problem the the legislature previous legislature and the governors at the time and the city council all thought it was a great idea to create deregulatory schemes in order to allow prices to go market so over the last 25 years we've lost over a million now we have tens of thousands of vacant units why do we have tens of thousands of vacant units because because landlords don't want to rent anymore because they can't get rid of anybody so it's one side or the other side right it's not a it's not clear as I said a lot of this is not black and white it's very gray but we we did not cause this problem and we certainly shouldn't be the target to fix quote unquote fix the problem and all they're going to do is make it even worse certainly so who's going to afford these construction like I know Long Island City has G apartment quiet let's say they go ahead and one bedom million doll two bedrooms and half million going to be rentals who's going to AFF 56,000 R problem for another day sir an average person can not pay 5,000 what okay so what the gentleman asked is who's going to afford these apartments whether they're for sale or their rentals and again they're really rentals they're not looking to build stuff for people to buy the goal is to allow developers to build wherever they want to build it has nothing to do with the ultimate alcome deregulation of land use they don't want anybody to own anything they don't want people to own anything but I'd say it's even baser than that they want to be able to build anywhere they want because the donors to the mayor who gave him all the money were all real estate people and that's who he's paying back it's really that simple just to point out that those two huge monster buildings on Queens Boulevard in rioo park were the developer was uh the Turkish uh the same Turkish developers so what she said was the two buildings in rioo park were the same yes CL um just want to jump in for a absolutely and then you can continue to ask all questions we had a discussion about this beforehand there's a little piece of this that I'd also like to share and that has to do with the accessory dwelling unit in backyards okay because along with everything that Paul's telling us there's a saying that's traveling with this whole thing the mayor keeps saying it is the responsibility of all New Yorkers to take responsibility for affordable housing so as Paul's pointing out there is no housing shortage there are claiming there's a housing shortage of affordable units okay and so are attempting to restrict the zoning in our neighborhoods that puts the blame on us for why people can't find places to live so we end up in a bit of a trap as we fight to protect neighborhood character and so on that we get label as people who don't care about other people it's a problem all right now the a we discussed this and I'm going to say it so the adus accessory dwelling units what that is by definition is that you can build something my understanding is uh 800 sare ft there's attic no no I'm talking about adus adus attic attachment to your back of your house or a freestanding building up to 800 ft it can be anywhere it can be in your house out of your house and in certain areas basement and sellers okay that's an Adu right yes the ones we're we're talking about that upset people the most okay so the basements we know a lot of them flood attics that's burn fires the fire department doesn't like any of this the potential for being able to take your garage and turn that into an apartment or the ones that get built in the backyard so the part of your garden where you like up to 50% of your backyard plant your tomatoes and all the rest of it or whatever you do back there that gets paved over and a little building goes back there that building the Restriction is five do five F feet from the back property line and 10 ft from your back door so it jams everything in so you have to imagine that you may not want to do it but your next door neighbor might want to do it so the house next to you becomes multifam the reason I'm going into this and I'm give this back sure the reason I'm going into this is because we have a homelessness problem in New York and there are pilot programs to create a voucher program so that the city gives a pays a landlord the rent to house a person and once you get the person in you'll never get them out they must find a way also as all of this is going on to deal with homelessness in addition and my position on this is essentially it is not our responsibility it is your responsibility it is not my backyard where this is going to happen we have empty property and you can tell me where the the m1's empty around the city a whole bunch of them big swats of property where there can be housing or mobile homes or something like that very nice to get the homeless off the street but not in our backyards so I just want to tuck that in here and then also at the end I want to talk about a couple of things we might do including signing the letter so we have the letter that you can sign and there's two meetings coming up that I want to tell you about but just so you know now I'm gonna give this back thank you B so one thing I do want to mention and then I'll take your question this uh I was at a meeting so I again we have at least 150 people here tonight which is fantastic on Saturday I was in Cambria Heights 550 people turned out and and there were dozens turned away because it would have been against fire code it was at the Cambria Heights Library and they were actually live streaming the event from a classroom in the basement with 10 and something people in it with people in the hallway looking through the windows and 400 people on the first floor with three TV screens live streamed from the basement and let me tell you they are planning to drop a homeless shelter in the middle of Cur Heights and if you know Cur Heights at all it's 90% single family detached homes it's right on the Nassau County border and they want to put put I I believe it's a 300 bed shelter for men there well the mayor says that it's not happening but meanwhile we looked up and it says nonprofit organization contracted with the Department of homeless services so again all the stuff I said before it's and again Claud everything you're saying is spoton no one we we need to be showing up again 150 people fabulous we need to have 500 people we need to have a th000 people and we are building that right now and and I'm sure Claud is going to talk a little bit about this but we have stuff that if you have the time we're going to make sure you're going to be showing up to these events sir let me take the woman in the back first please you mentioned that our community board six approved this your board approved this unanimously with conditions the conditions were minimal I believe I'm sorry I didn't hear that I didn't hear community board as far as I know cuz I was I I spoke at 10 Community boards nine Community boards who all voted no and the 10th I didn't go to but they voted no I I actually reached out to community board 6 and I never received a reply and community board 6 voted I believe unanimously yes I may be wrong about that but I'm pretty sure they unanimously yes with conditions but the conditions were nothing yeah I mean they really weren't anything important we can do about that can you do anything about that well I highly recommend I I'll let Claudia do this cuz this is her [Music] value okay so here's here's you know you can see the tangle that this is you can see the administrative tangle they've created the complicated length of the of the plans and so on it takes a planner to get through it you know so everything about this has been complex deliberately so so just hang on a second so tonight is our meeting why because the week of May 20 the city council is voting on the economic portion that's the corner store and the middle of the block thing that I talked about the 18 proposals the 18 proposals correct so that's why we're having our meeting to get ourselves together here that's why I have a letter here that can go to Lyn Schulman and all the other people to basically say you better vote no so that's step one step two Wednesday is that this Wednesday our community board community board 6 is receiving the presentation now this is a public meeting receiving the presentation from Department of City Planning laying out the housing part that Paul just explained to you so I'm going to that I you know and you all should come to him you can come to the community board meetings it's in for a hall and when a whole bunch of people show up they won't even know what to do with us the way the commentary happens at our community board meeting is that they moved comment to the front of the meeting and you know you can disagree with me Paul but it puts us in a position where we can't even say anything because the presentation follows us oh thank thank you so much so I personally want to go and sit and watch these people tell us how great this is without giving you any information right knowing that it isn't okay so fine so we show up a whole bunch of us show up community board 6 listen and they'll just see a lot of people on like like oh they're on to us okay then on June 4 the zoning and planning committee of community board 6 holds a public hearing on the housing portion that Paul's been talking about and between Wednesday night in June 4 because you gave me all your email addresses and telephone numbers and now I know where to find you that means that I can basically put statements if anyone wants to call we usually are allowed to testify for two minutes and you have to practice um it's three but they cut you down to two I'll get five because I'm a committee you know a president whatever I am but the thing is what happens is when a whole ton of people show up they'll say you have to you have to register on the community board site to say you're coming you have to also say what you're coming to talk about and then they'll say oh well we we heard 10 of them we don't have to hear all of them so sometimes they cut down on the on the ability be a minute instead of two minutes well no they they tell everybody that we don't want to hear from all of you cuz we just heard the 10 people no I've been through this that's interesting yeah they just say oh yeah we understand so you can all show up and want to testify even if you don't get to speak look at this room okay so they have to be put on notice that we're just not going for it then there's in the fall but you talk about the other things that you're doing because you're doing like damage rallies let's there you go let's switch back so so it's I always love to be educated because I've never been to a community board 6 meeting before and I didn't realize that they sto the people from testifying that's a new one for me um a lot of times yeah I see you here a lot of times when you get uh you know 150 people turning out they cut it down to one minute or one and a half minutes but they do typically most Community boards do let everybody at least testify so that's a new one for me sir when when you talk about the homeless in this regard does that include the illegal migrants or is that just I didn't bring it up Claudia brought but I will I will say this don't let me just say this and it's the only thing I'm going to say on the migrant situation is a temporary transitory situation right we've had 200,000 people come here and yet there's only 60,000 people left from two years ago or people you know so there's a cycle of people who are coming in and leaving from the city we have no no idea what the end product of this is going to be so that I would separate from our permanent homeless population or but some of them are going to become homeless and going to add on to the problem I'm sorry say again some of them may stay and become of the homeless some and exacerbated even well you know we have something in our city Charter that 40 years ago a bunch of lawyers said oh well according to the city Charter anybody who shows up can get housing in the city of New York another reason to think about maybe not being part of the city of New York anymore because you can get rid of as of right development and Zoning you can have your own kids in your own schools you you don't have to House people and I don't want to sound unsympathetic but you're not being forced to do things that we we are not capable capable of nor should we be responsible self-inflicted wound it's self-inflicted and unfortunately you know what is it put two lawyers in a room what happens right put six lawyers in a room you'll end up with maybe one lawyer left and again I deal with legal stuff all the time again I'm not a lawyer but we we have intractable problems that will never be solved but does the city really want to drive out the main taxpayers and the stability of the city that's the question we have to ask and that's a question that has to be asked to every elected official I see sir and then in the back go ahead yeah my name is David Abraham I live in and I call the G Corporation this morning after the sign just right minutes ago I something urgent happened um and I asked them if somebody from the Corporation Bo could possibly come here I don't know if anybody did they sent somebody but several 100 homeowners there that I'm sure would be very very amenable to sharing everybody's concern in this world I know everybody some people feel maybe worried or scared but there are there is a lot ofical Power and voting power and um more Minds that we can bring into the picture because it's just a matter of time till um you know I've spoken to the I spoken to people that are I work in the Republican Party politics not with the Queens Republican party just with people that are trying to make Queens Republican again and um this whole subject has been discussed at infino in the last two years I mean it's it's one of the main topics that we talk about all the time so there really are who ever in charge here I'd like to speak to them at the end of the meeting let me just say yeah I just want you to know that I extended invitations just so you know and I have been in touch with them but there's several meetings tonight in the community all at the same time and that's one of the reasons that people didn't show up just so you know where there's Outreach in in addition there were at least at the beginning of the meeting several people from The Gardens here and I have met with the board of the gardens I just want everybody to know that I have met with them they are aware of this and I am in contact with them so again I'm not the the grand Pua here but my point is it's it's out there so what I've said to the gardens and I say to every group is I'm happy to speak to anybody about this because the more people that know the better chance we have at either killing it or coming up with a solution Sorry Miss there was somebody else before you I'll come back to you um sir in the back y thank you from what I previous City Planning Commission would come out and do individual neighborhoods talk about characteristics take feed do you know if they're will to do that go to Civic associations if you saw what I showed you they're not doing any analysis they're not doing anything this is not the city planning of even two years ago we are in a new world we are in a new world and we are in a uh planning department that is hostile to communities period they do not believe it is their uh job to actually do anything with communities except impose their plan on you has the civic association asked to come out and present to the public no hi so when just so you know it's a good question when we did the original Dam zoning um as I say you go through the zonian planning of your board then the board then Queen City Planning then city city planning when we did that years ago a bunch of people on the City Planning Commission in the city got in a little bus and came out and we were able to walk them around and that was the final uh thing they needed to see in order to okay our proposal however I have invited community commity board six out here two times I've invited all 50 of them to come walk around and I'll buy them coffee at McDonald's and so far they haven't taken me up on it and they think it's kind of weird that I keep saying that the reason I say it is because they don't understand this area at all and they keep voting against us okay so again sir I I see you but I miss I see I know I see you too so again previously the department of City Planning worked with communities they would work with communities and work with elected officials and work with Community boards in AE in a previous lifetime not to not too far back we are every Administration is different and this Administration is like nothing I've ever seen in 30 years there is no Community engagement as I said they they bragged that they had 175 meetings which came out to three meetings per community board they were not transparent they were very opaque they are not giving details many of the times the DCP people are coming and saying when someone asks a question I'll get back to you on that I don't know the answer to that one I've had to correct them multiple times at at meetings which is crazy um these people should know the basics of what they're presenting they're reading off of a sheet of paper that they've been supplied they don't even know what they're talking about it's scary it's very scary Miss and then you sorry so who who had raised it no no no somebody had oh I'm sorry SAR yeah who's the main sponsor of this mayor Eric Adams on City Council on the city council so I'm G to tell you a little story Adrian Adams who's The Speaker of the city council she was at a thing called the NYU firman Center For Real Estate the NYU Ferman Center is a think tank on real estate with NYU the head of the NYU firman re uh Center for uh real estate is Vicky Bean Vicky Bean was the deputy mayor under Deasia Vicky ban is also the author of a wildly false report that she used to try to tell people that white wealthy neighborhoods were down zoned and lowincome neighborhoods of color were upzoned and that went to speaker Johnson with his planning together and I disproved the entire thing and so did the the folks in southeast queens and the folks in other parts of the city and the incredible diversity we have everywhere and all of the rezonings that were done she's a liar and she controls a very and she's also by the way one of the people voting on the casinos she's on the state casino board she's one of the four state casino Commissioners okay so she is very much pushing this at this new NYU firman thing speaker Adams was there and a question was asked about because this was all about city of yes and she said and I think she was very honest in her statement my community remember she covers uh uh you know South Southeast Queen She covers like uh South Jamaica Jamaica St Alan Springfield Gardens South Lone Park a lot of one and two family homes homeowner areas middle income in fact ter are's majority homeowner and she said you know my community is going to be very opposed to the city of yes they like their neighborhood and they like their homes it's a very honest statement four days later she put out a joint editorial with the mayor saying the city of yes must come to fruition and all about how the city of yes was the best thing that ever happened and we have to make it happen what did you get for it I I can't speculate on that with this I I'm not I'm just telling you the facts about that you guys can draw your own conclusions I'm not going to talk about that but there are people on the council who are in favor of this there are state senators and assembly members who are also in favor of this you need to investigate that on your own find out how your assembly members and state senators feel about all of this as well as obviously your council member and other council members one council member again doesn't represent this area his name is Lincoln wrestler Lincoln wrestler represents Greenpoint Williamsburg Brooklyn Heights I've known him for a long time not my favorite person but head of the progressive caucus of the city of New York he thinks the city of yes is just great okay so there are people on the council who have made it very clear that are in favor and there are people on the council who said they are de set against it the problem is we need 26 votes that's the problem sorry uh you're first and then we'll come around any sense of how many council members are okay 18 18 no votes I need eight votes next I need eight you need I yeah I need like 34 votes but 26 is a minimum go ahead um thank you for this this is very informative um I know a lot of people who couldn't make it tonight is there a scaled down digestible version of this PowerPoint or something that we could pass around so to answer your question the camri heights video that had 550 people was posted up today go to Paul grat Sano at YouTube you know put in Google Paul grat Sano YouTube city of yes say no to the city of yes it'll all come up we are filming this one tonight we're posting it up we also had one at the the queen Civic Congress which is a big umbrella Organization for civic and homeowners groups at their luncheon on April 14th and I gave a 22-minute version of this it's pretty easy to digest but I'm just going to tell you the one that we did on Saturday is off the hook it is wild and it's good to watch and I think that to me that's the best one to watch because not only the enthusiasm but I think the honest discussion that took place was really something okay next yes I'm G to come yeah go ahead you go and then you in the back okay is there a website um yes so my my website is save one family n.org but we we're really lazy and we haven't connected everything but we will but again Paul graciano comma YouTube comma say no to the city of yes it should pop right up yes and did BP Richards vote Yes on the city absolutely he thinks the city of yes is great sir sounds like it's almost going to definitely happen coun right who says I I what I said was okay what I said was I have 18 votes I need 26 okay that's what I said and probably I need more because some of the people are at the last second didn't to change their votes y so I'm really glad you brought that up um because over the time that the Civic is fighting has been fighting things what we've encountered over the years what people may not realize here is that on the property on Metropolitan Avenue where the schools are the thing that was slated to go in there was a mall when I say a mall I mean from Wood Haven all the way to almost Continental from Union Turnpike to Metro you know not running on the houses over to the backs of the houses that project was uh being developed potentially by far City Ratner the entire thing was under the comprehensive retail strategy of Rudy Giuliani as campaign money payback to developers we found out about that mall civic association we fought it and we stopped it we also stopped the 26 screen Multiplex That was supposed to go in there and then we managed to get schools built because Queens with 30,000 seats short at that time the entire time that we were fighting it which took 15 years the entire time we were told don't bother you'll never win don't bother it's as of right every place we went people told us to give up give up give up and we just started laughing and finally as of right designation is kind of like them telling you go away rubber stamp and I finally realized one day I I said at the board of standards and appeals I don't care if it is at rights it is as a right stop saying it to me I don't want it my neighborhood doesn't want it stop and we won we also did the Dan we've done a number of things so my attitude my attitude is always if I'm going to lose I'm going down fighting that's it right and and I want to say you know you guys don't know me but I am not the patron Sate of lost causes I wouldn't be here tonight talking to you if I said oh it's over you know that's not the way it is this this thing is very much in play and you know and again Claud is 100% right I've been told so many times in the many fights I've been involved in give up there's no point it's a done best it's a done deal forget about it and you know what even people won against robertt Moses so I I think we can beat Eric Adams sorry there's some I'm going around I'll come back I see you guys there was someone back there who was talking oh there we go yeah go ahead hi um I think we're all basically here can you tell us what the next step we all need to show up on Wednesday first to sign the give us the tools that we need to make sure that they see our faces and know we're pissed off what what is yours we show up Wednesday from people sign letter what are our next steps so what I've been building and you know Claudia was very explicit and it was perfect but what we what we're doing and what I've been doing for the last six months is building a Citywide Alliance so we now have over 200 organizations in Queens Brooklyn the Bronx and Staten Island it's it's like nothing I've ever I've been doing this for 30 years we've never done this before including us including you yeah the brand the brand newly rev revitalized Forest Hill Civic and Community Association right sorry so which is 100 years old yes correct so my point is there's strength in numbers and the one thing and and full disclosure I've run for office I've done very well every time I just never won you know how it works it's 50 plus one I've always I've done well I've done really well but that's never right city council but not here I live in I live in Flushing Northeast Queens but listen I got 46% of the vote when I ran against Paul bone the bone family that should tell you everything so I did really really well but I lost the point is I don't really care about that what I care about is my home so yeah sorry there was someone else back there let me get them and I'm coming this way go ahead 9le empty dorm on 69th and [Music] kle windows that was like one like a good to put Tower even already so yeah there are flas points in every neighborhood and every meeting I come to they're like but what about this and yeah there's one place though okay okay to your point though um does everybody know the house with a construction fence around it on n and what yeah so it's been like that for 10 years why and I know because my dog was a puppy and she's now 11 the first time I confronted this the the guy put up the construction fence he put up the drawing for a multif family dwelling and I saw it and I and he had Connecticut plates and I said listen you know I don't need to bother you but if you try to build that you're going to get stopped because it's against the zoning that we have here like the zoning we put in I said you can't really build that I don't know why your architect allowed you to put that drawing he should have checked the zoning he cursed me out really badly and um I said listen I said I don't make phone calls to the Buildings Department I said so when you get into trouble don't come looking for me I said I don't do that I said but you're going to lose your shirt now that property has been stopped again and again and again and it's sitting there the way that it is for 10 years so our zoning has held up for us I just wanted to mention that however yeah should the zoning change under city of yes it'll be a store yeah it'll be a Store retail store um and and another just the last thing I'll mention about what you asked is what else can you do so we're we are putting together in the next few weeks a series of very big press conferences because now that the budget is over in Albany and now that that drama is done and now that this stuff is happening we want to get everybody's attention so we're actually doing it in borrow Hall we're going to do one we're going to do one in Brook one in Staten Island one in the Bronx and we have commitments for over 2,000 people already to come down to City Hall and we're hoping that you're 150 plus will add to that so that's all in the future we will make sure everybody knows when we're doing this but it's going to be sometime in the next month that we're putting all of this together okay um the last thing on that topic and then I'll take the next question because that's before the boards vote correct that's right that's before the boards vote correct I mentioned that Bill assembly Bill [Music] 9417 tell your assembly members they need to co-sponsor and vote for that bill and if they tell you I don't know who that bill is I don't know what that bill is I'll look into it you tell them we're watching you we're telling this to everybody again it's not personal it's not about partisanship it's about this bill being very important to the future of this community and every other community a 9417 a lot of us would like to leave where are the petitions petitions are here they're here oh they're here I'm sorry next yes miss you have our addresses our email addresses Etc can we get some of mailing with yes I will send it to correct I actually sent a list of all emails already to the council members so yes okay it looks like people have had enough thank you you're very welcome everybody I'll talk to people here yes Paul Grano g r a z i a n o thank you
