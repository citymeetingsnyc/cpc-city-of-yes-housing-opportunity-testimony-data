[Music] if I could have your attention thank you it's great to see everybody here today I wish we were here you know it's a great day for celebration and talking about all the great things that our honores have gotten many of whom I've known for years and years and it's it's fantastic but unfortunately we have an underlying crisis in our communities and that's one of the reasons that I'm here to talk to you today many of you know what's been going on for the last three and a half years where our own government at the city and at the state level has told us that our communities don't deserve to exist and we are here today because we are facing the ultimate crisis point on this with the city of yes [Music] so we without going into tremendous detail of the past we are now facing as is titled here an Extinction event for our communities and it's all being done in the name of progress in the name of we need housing there's a lot of rhetoric and propaganda being put out by the state and certainly by the city and if you pay attention to one thing please pay attention to what I'm showing you today because all of this is coming up the economic portion of this is being voted on as I believe uh Linda Lee stated uh at the end of uh or the beginning of June late May early June that housing piece was released on Thursday okay so we are really in a situation where this Administration the department of City Planning and the mayor and his allies are all trying to Ram this through as soon as possible so let's talk a little bit about this and you'll excuse me because I'm using my mouse on my leg it's like I I wish I had a little table here or something but I don't have it um so we're going to start with a little propaganda back in October we were I I I was looking on the department of City planning's x/ Twitter feed and I saw this and I did a double tap um it's called 1989 this was obviously in reference to Taylor Swift's album uh it really was actually but they show a map of New York City the zoning map from that time and the amazing thing is the quote that comes with it and the quote is we've got bad blood with Robert Moses and we've made a lot of progress to improve New York City Zoning but we're not out of the woods yet that's why we're chasing our wildest dreams in city of yes to shake exclusionary zoning off and say once and for all welcome to New York okay now I don't know what um created agency the DCP has hired or or staffers from this but this is not the reality that we live in I I want to show of hands who here owns their own home okay who owns a one family home who owns a two family home who owns a co-op or condom okay but the vast majority of people here are homeowners right we are all owner occupiers we are not landlords that's not what we are we make up a third of the population uh in in New York City a third of the units are owner occupied the city has decided this Administration that we do not deserve to exist and that goes for Middle income co-ops and condos we know this as well so since they brought up Moses let's talk about Robert Moses for a second okay obviously a very controversial individual we all know his legacy a lot of it bad some of it not so bad but these are some of his quotes you might see a uh through line to the current Administration your principal error is this to imagine that the people's views are of any importance at all we must Advance their fortunes without having any respect for their opinions you can draw any kind of picture you want on a clean slate and indulge your every whim in the wilderness and laying out of New Delhi canara or Brazilia but when you operate in an overbuild Metro Metropolis you have to hack your way with a me Ax and and maybe this is something that connects to our current situation if you elect a matina idol mayor you're going to have a musical comedy Administration okay these are direct quotes from Robert Moses there was a woman named Jane Jacobs she she fought him again these are complicated gray people this is not a black and white situation at all but it's interesting this article came out in the post 8 years ago meet the woman who took on Robert Moses and saved Lower Manhattan here's one quote from her cities grow up they just happen bit by bit hand the city to the planners and they'll make it a desert hand it to the people and they'll make it habitable okay as someone who's a planner I agree with her 100% because most planners are not planners they're real estate people and there's a difference today the Daily News put out an editorial it says a home for us let me read you the pertinent part and why this all fits into this narrative however what should be dismissed offand is anything that too heavily emphasizes neighborhood good character property values or Fring over increased density these tedious arguments are missing the point which is that a lack of housing stock threatens affordability and quality of life in all of New York and there's no way to dodge this by holding firm against development the bucolic character of any particular neighborhood is going to matter little as the current residents are priced out for those who desperately want to live in a suburb we'll remind you that there are several in the immediate vicinity of the five burrows this is New York City okay so we are now in a posttruth environment on every level whether it's coming from elected officials rhetoric from The Daily News the New York Times uh the post who all are speaking their own language but they're not speaking the language of reality which is that should this go through in any form it will destroy huge parts of New York City there will be no benefit except for the developers who are doing things this was from the hearing on Monday for Economic Opportunity at the city council this was actually a slide that the chair of the city planning Mission Dan garnik put up this slide is super interesting how many people here are on community boards raise your hands okay a lot of people on community boards right so you'll see this timeline and you'll see something very interesting there's a circle here and it says 175 meetings with Community boards that's a lot of meetings except we have 59 Community boards so that works out to about three meetings per community board okay over here it says 4 five Bor presidents including our Bor president Donovan Richards supports the city of yes okay you should talk to him so here's what they left out the majority of community boards voted this down 2third of community boards voted this down unanimously or near unanimously oneir voted yes with conditions now for those of you who aren't on community boards there are four ways you can vote Yes Yes with conditions no with conditions or no the problem is that City Planning and the process the actual land use process is that a yes vote is a yes vote and a no vote is a no vote and they frankly don't care about the conditions and they are not included when they are actually tallied so many many of the yes votes are actually now no votes because their conditions were not met so the department of City Planning included a few comments from a few Community Boards called that public participation and lawed how they listened to the city and the community boards and modified The Language by about a page or two okay so let's talk a little bit about the Synergy between the economic piece and the housing piece how many of you have seen me give my my spiels for the last four months okay quite a few of you yes so I I don't want to bore you with all of that but I do want to talk about what happened and the and the gaslighting that is going on from the Department of City Planning and our elected officials some of them this was a slide that was shown at every community board community board members will remember they came out with these one sentence descriptions with a single soft photo saying create a process to allow for small new bodegas and other locally serving storefronts in residential areas this is when DCP was giving an hour uh speech on this and then expecting the community board to vote on 1127 pages of text 1127 how many of you read the 1127 pages of text okay thank you so let's look at this one this is what they showed to City Council on Monday isn't it interesting that they're showing different information uh oh sorry different information to the city council than what they were showing going to the community board so this is actually closer to the test because what you saw in here this one sentence that's not what this is this is going to allow the ability for the Department of City Planning and the City Planning Commission to allow up to 2500 square ft of commercial within 100 ft of every corner on every block in New York City let me show you what that looks like hold on a second here oops sorry here we go so this is Throgs Neck in the Bronx I'm just going to Breeze through this those are your existing commercial areas these are the locations where they could put commercial here City Island same thing your existing commercial here's where they could put commercial canari existing commercial Georgetown mil Bas and Bergen Beach existing commercial Ridgewood existing commercial we all think you know Ridgewood I I know Paul's here and a lot of people from Ridgewood okay Q Gardens farest tills Gardens and farest tills South that's the gardens in the blue this is the uh basley section South Jamaica by basley Pond there's that's correct and Howard Beach and Lindenwood there's your Cross Bay Boulevard and Lindenwood shopping center now all of these these areas up here are in another section which I'm going to talk about briefly about allowing 15,000 square ft of commercial in a residential area if you have 1.5 Acres or more okay so let's let's go back here let me show you what was happening here at the city council hearing the council members asked the department of city planning to CPC kept saying over and over again well we've created a process that the community boards and the bar president they're going to be able to vote their approval on this as you can see subject to both environmental review and community board approval the council members did their homework and they said very clearly uh wait so you're not going to approve this at City Planning if the community boards say no and it was asked three or four times and and chair gnik hemmed and haw tried to change the subject but finally stated they are advisory only which they are and you cannot tell people who know the process that it's subject to environmental review and community board approval it's not subject to community board approval if the community board say no CPC can say yes okay so let me show you this this is community board 8 so community board 8 is a typical board in Queens it's got some very Suburban areas some more urban areas and and stuff in between the light yellow is one family zoning orange is two family zoning these are the areas and the reason I bring this up is that the narrative from the city has changed on this first it was we want to allow commercial uh it's not going to happen though don't worry about it we're never going to approve it then they put out this press release right here this came out the day after the City Planning Commission approved this create a process to allow corner stores in residential areas as approximately 265,000 New Yorkers currently live in areas where a new corner store could not be located within a quarter of a mile of their home well that would be Jamaica States and holliswood for the most part all all the other areas you see those areas are within a quarter of a mile so let's let's take a quick look okay just to let you know that 265,000 people sounds like a lot it's 3% of the population of New York City when has the City Planning Commission ever done anything for 3% of the population of New York City something doesn't add up right so let's look at why they want this to go through here's Jamaica States this this is your zoning R12 R2 r3x two family zoning here multif family and single family let's look at this little area here by the Grand Central typical Block in Jamaica States green leafy single family homes every one of these locations could have commercial any any Endeavor if this becomes law let's look at this property in particular I'm going to show you how the house housing combines with the commercial portions of this proposal this is a big piece of property 16,800 sare ft here's your house hey present zoning one family only 5700 minimum lot size you have to have a parking space okay currently you can subdivide this property to make a one family home needs a parking space a single unit The Proposal is to get rid of all single and two family zoning in the city of New York so they want to create two family houses plus accessory dwelling units which would be nine units minimum with much larger lot coverage higher floor area ratio smaller minimum lot size okay all of this stuff and no parking requirements for any new residential development in the city of New York one family 300 units doesn't matter this would be allowed under the transit oriented development Transit oriented development is part of this entire proposal this Transit oriented development if I can find it this is a map of community board 11 see all the areas in blue those are all areas that will be in the transit Zone these are areas in Jamaica States all of these properties would be allowed to have an apartment building on them in Jamaica States not just a one or a two or even a three family home but an apartment building the same thing in uh in lauron as well same thing in lauron same thing in douglason same thing everywhere okay this situation I just want to confirm with people here this whole discussion about exclusionary zoning is false this is a false discuss discussion most cities have 65 to 85% single family zoning we have 15% and another 9% is two family this is not about exclusionary zoning this is Seattle 81% Chicago 79% Portland 77% Los Angeles 75% Minneapolis 70% even Washington DC 36% % New York City 15% notice where most of it is east of the Van Wick Expressway 2/3 of all single family zoning here's a map this is all the two family zoning along with single family zoning all of this would be changed to three plus families per parcel Baseline along with changing the lot sizes and the floor areas and everything you see here are Transit zones these are all areas where apartment buildings will be allowed anything you see here that's cross-hatched or blue the cross-hatched is current one and two family zones the blue areas are higher density so again this would be in a Transit Zone all of Jamaica States is in a Transit Zone this property would generate a 33 unit apartment build building where there is currently a single family home 33 units no parking required okay and here's where the Synergy with the economic piece is they go to the City Planning Commission they say we want an authorization to put in 2,500 ft of retail on the first floor proposal number 16 so in a nutshell that gives you a pretty good idea I think of what we're dealing with similar to campus commercial just very quickly visually Bell Boulevard in Northern major uh commercial area this is a rental complex I had a conversation previously with someone who's in co-ops let's forget about the co-ops just look at a rental section these are classic Garden Apartments the the key word is Garden right Garden Apartments all of these are meant to be infill in this Administration this is meant to have more housing so you would get a building and then because it's on a campus they could put 15,000 square ft of commercial on that first floor so this is just two of 18 economic proposals and about 40 proposals in the housing and I I I'm not even going into great detail but this is the challenge of Our Lives I've said this over and over and you know we won in 2021 we won against the governor in 2022 and 2023 now we have a mayor a City Planning Commission and their allies working feverishly on a expedited timeline to Ram this through and destroy our communities so with that happy note I'm happy to take a question or two if you want me to yeah sure thank you everybody thank you Paul what an amazing fascinating presentation from Paul and he's going to remain around the attorney the attorney general is here she's going to speak and then once she's done if you have questions for Paul you can uh you can do that all right
