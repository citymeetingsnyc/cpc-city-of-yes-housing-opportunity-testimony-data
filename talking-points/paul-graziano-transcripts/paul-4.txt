everybody all [Music] right here because for the last three and a half years we have literally been under Fire from our own government our own government has been trying to destroy our communities in 2020 we had Corey Johnson he was the speaker of the city council he came in with a thing called planning together planning to it's always a good name city of yes planning together the housing compact that was the governor for the last years his plan was to eliminate single family zoning across the city of New York and force every community board to upzone every decade and if you don't do it yourself with your council person then there'd be a new city planning with a new head of that group over the current City Planning and they would designate areas at will so myself Renee Hill who used to be the chair of community board 12 and she's was the president of Addle Park Civic fabulous human being we Renee Hill and I created a group and we went to all the community boards in the city in six weeks and got everybody riled up and said this is crazy and a few months later the whole thing was dropped and we said okay great then we got a new governor right who came in Governor H so she came in and in early 2022 she came and said because just you know for all purposes just for you to know I'm a bit of a nerd right so not that you can't tell but um she she showed on her State of the State address in 2022 and she said one line and she said we're going to get rid of outdated zoning laws that are holding back H housing Supply so I looked at the thing you know her State of the State address eliminate single family zoning across the state of New York Force every municipality to accept adus accessory dwelling units which we're going to talk about today because this is in the city of yes this is a main point of the city of yes take away home rule from local communities and local decision making Force Transit oriented development which we're also going to talk about today around all train stations and the year later subway stations high high density and give blanket amnesty to all illegal conversions in the city of New York so we created a group called save one family New York and we went all over the state it wasn't just in the city nasso suffk Westchester Hudson Valley Buffalo Rochester Ithaca you name it I I started cold calling people some people hung up on me some people didn't and we created a big Statewide Coalition and and I give credit where credit is due your local elected here were some of the hardest fighting ERS in shutting that down Senator comry uh assembly member Alicia Hinman and several others were really critical in stopping her in 2022 however I warned everybody if she comes back she's going to come back with it again and sure she did last year the housing compact same thing that she did before except now every Community was going to have to increase housing every year forever and this time didn't back down you remember the budget was like 35 days late last year yeah that was because she refused to take that out of the budget and again it was only because of Senator comry assembly member Hinman and Ed bronstein and Bayside and a number of other people mostly from Queens and from Staten Island and a few other places in the city who said if you do this we we can't sign off on the budget and finally they they essentially walked out of negotiations and she dropped everything but by that time the city of yes was already coming through and just to let you know the budget was just approved again at the state level she tried once again blanket amnesty for illegal conversions allowing basements and sellers everywhere and you know who stopped it Senator comry assembly member Hinman assembly member brunstein assembly member uh neie rosik who's in Fresh Meadows who held up the budget for 20 days and said we are not going to sign off on this budget unless you create a situation where Community boards can say no so in Queens and remember this has been targeted at Queens 13 out of 14 boards it's not legal only one board it may be and that's Long Island City and Sunnyside to which I say Enjoy right we we don't want that here okay so this that you're seeing right here is something that was posted up six months ago by the department of City Planning Department of City Planning put up a map of zoning in New York from 1989 and they they tried to be cute and make it like a Taylor Swift thing which is kind of ridiculous but but that that tells you the mentality of the people who are running the department of City Planning today which is not the department of City Planning when they work with us to protect Cambria Heights and to protect Bayside and all of our other communities two decades who who's on their home for 10 years 20 years years 30 years 40 years 50 years okay do you guys remember 20 years ago when we our organizations our neighborhoods came together there was a great article we have someone from the Chronicles sitting right here the Queen's Chronicle oh Q ands I'm sorry my mistake where's the chronicle so look at this this is from 19 years ago almost to the day Cambria Heights residents approved down zoning plans who remembers that raise your hand okay a few people members of community board 13 overwhelmingly approved a Cambria Heights down zoning plan presented to them by the Queen's office of City Planning Monday night this is the fastest rezoning that's ever happened in Queens said Richard henre chair of board 13 we must realize the efforts of the planning office because usually down zonings takes well over a year Helen brick said the down zoning effort in cambury Heights began in October 2004 20 years ago and will hopefully be fully approved by the city and in effect by the end of June the plan would rezone 5,722 Lots within 196 blocks in cambury Heights 70% will become r2a zones guys I'm the author of The r2a this is the anti- mcmansion Zone got it okay you were the second Community to get this in Queens after Bayside where this gentleman lives and is the chair of community board 11 who also was my side my sidekick on all of this okay helenberg said that cury Heights is only the second community in the city to take advantage of the new r2a zones which were established in the recent resoning of Bas set and place greater restrictions on overdevelopment in residential communities under the plan presented Cambria Heights current R2 zones which are areas of detach one family homes represent 70% of the community will become r2a zones Cambria Height's resident Doris Bodine who by the way sits on the board of the Queens Farm Museum okay said she was quote relieved the plan was approved by the board I've lived in the community for 40 years in a detached family home and I don't want to see the character of the community change she said members of community board the 13 oh I'm sorry here we go oh that's the problem sorry City Planning represent this is how different things were 1520 years ago City Planning representative Elizabeth ero who presented the plan to about 60 Cambria Heights residents said the new r2a Zone really quote reflects what is already there and is aimed at trying to prevent overbuilding in the area the only concerns raised at the meeting were that some current residents would be in violation of the new zoning regulations once they take effect but ero said that 80% of the community would currently meet or be under the new requirements set by the r2a zones and anyone not meeting the requirements would be grandfathered okay into the new regulations and not in violation there is a high degree of compliance and Conformity to these requirements she said r2a will provide a tighter building envelope and doesn't allow certain exemptions which allow homes to become bigger Kevin jamat president of cambri height civic association expressed his support for the plan at the meeting thank you again I apologize this plan will allow for reasonable exemptions but stop mcmansions jamat told the crowd we are in a Sprint right now against developers to get Cambria Heights reson before they change the character of the neighborhood how different things were a short period of time ago okay so they showed this map and they followed it up with this quote we've got bad blood with Robert Moses and we've made a lot of progress to improve New York City Zoning but we're not out of the woods yet that's why we're chasing our wildest dreams in city of yes to shake exclusionary zoning off and say once and for all Welcome to New York now I don't know what kid from Iowa wrote this but clearly you know we all know the legacy of Robert Moses we we're living it every day he was he was a a a very controversial individual right he was he did a lot of just a nice pict well he was he someone who did a lot of bad things he's also someone who did some not so bad things and frankly you guys wouldn't be here and neither would us if the Cross Island was never built so I'm more pragmatic about it that yeah he did a lot of terrible things and some of the things he did here here's some quotes from him your principal error is this to imagine that the people's view are of any importance at all we must Advance their fortunes without having any respect for their opinions you can draw any kind of picture you want on a clean slate and indulge your every whim in the wilderness and laying out a new Deli canara or Brazilia which were all these new capitals in the 1950s right across the world but when you operate in an overbuilt Metropolis you have to hack your way with a meax and if you elect a matina idol mayor you're going to have a musical comedy Administration and let's just say that these are clearly the philosophies of the current Administration and I would create a dangerously accurate description of the current Administration with creating unneeded self-created drama including why we're standing here today okay let's quickly look at the person who stopped him cold in the 1950s and 60s this was a woman named Jane Jacobs ever hear of her no no she was an urbanist she he wanted to build and again some of the older folks here might know this he wanted to build the Lower Manhattan Expressway which would go from the Holland Tunnel to the Brooklyn Bridge and he was going to demolish Tribeca and Soho in the process okay now remember Tribeca and Soho today is very different than it was in the 50s and 60s it was a desolate abandoned community at that point but she was one of the key people that stopped it and one of her quotes is cities grow up they just happen big by bid hand a city to the planners and they'll make it a desert hand it to the people and they'll make it habitable okay and and I'm a planner and I agree 100% with her because there's a difference between the community coming together and deciding their future and having it imposed on them and what we did 20 years ago was in full consultation with the community we worked our butts off to get where we were and this was again not just here but all of Southeast Queens all the Northeast Queens Central Queens Staten Island North and East Bronx Southern Brooklyn Central Brooklyn you name it we did this and we were successful did we get everything we wanted no did we get more than we had gotten in 50 years definitely this Administration has stated publicly lower density neighborhoods are the cause of the housing crisis contextual neighborhoods those rezonings were a mistake they should have never happened because they took away the ability to build densely and we have to take we have to get rid of it they've literally stated this publicly we have a Target on our backs okay so this is an editorial that came out three weeks ago Daily News a home for us let me just read this one part for you however what should be dismissed off hand is anything that too heavily emphasizes quote neighborhood character property values are fretting over increased density these tedious arguments tedious are missing the point which is that a lack of housing stock threatens affordability and quality of life in all of New York and there's no way to dodge this by holding firm against development the buic character of any particular neighborhood is going to matter little as as the current residents are priced out for those who desperately want to live in a suburb we'll remind you that there are several in the immediate vicinity of the five burrows this is New York City so if anybody agrees with me if anybody has a subscription to this paper you might want to get rid of it okay so this is what the mainstream press is saying how dare you stand up for your neighborhood how dare you stand up for your quality of life and the blood and sweat and tears you you had to go through to become a homeowner in your community y because none of that matters now let's just say this how many people live in New York City okay no I I I was a rhetorical question sorry my my mistake about 8.2 million people okay how many people lived in New York City in 1960 8.2 million people 8.1 million people we went down a million you all remember the 60s into the 70s into the 80s it took 30 years to get back to where we were in 2000 we went up in 2010 we went up a little more and then 5 years ago we've lost over 600,000 people so all the numbers of people that we had are gone so how much of our community how much of the city is zoned single family this is a very important question for you most cities in the country and this this is the statement that comes from this Administration from the governor we need to solve the housing crisis we have to get rid of exclusionary zoning that's our zoning exclusionary so in other words home ownership is off the table right detached single family homes or even two family homes are not part of the program in addition to compare New York City to the rest of the country where yes there is a long history of the cities like Seattle 81% of Seattle is own single family 81% everything you see in purple right 79% in Chicago wow 77% Portland Los Angeles Los Angeles 75% okay Minneapolis 70% even Washington DC 36% single family New York City yeah and where is it show me where it is east of the Van Wick Expressway you take our communities out of the mix there's virtually no single family zoning in the city of New York okay and this by the way for anybody question these are directly from an article from The New York Times from a couple years ago so I took these cut them paste them just so if anybody says oh where'd you get that data from it's from them okay now this is que east of the Van Wick everything you see in yellow is single family that is because of people like you people like me people like Paul and lots of other communities that fought like hell to protect their communities okay 50% of Queens east of the Van Wick is Zone single family another 25% is zone two family what they want to do is eliminate one and two family zing and what will happen is wow all of the one and two family zones will become three family minimum okay because every property will be allowed to have at least two families plus an accessory dwelling unit and we're going to talk about that as I said then they've come up with something called the transit Zone the transit zone is going to allow apartment buildings all over the place any place you see that's cross-hatched those are current one and two family zones this is rosale Laurelton Springfield Gardens uh Addle Park Queen's Village just a few blocks if you're actually it's just a few blocks north of Murdoch and you can see Northeast Queen Central queens and even to the West right in Ozone Park Howard Beach Etc few Gardens Forest Hills they will allow they call it the missing middle housing that would be the uh 100-year-old and older walk UPS ten the tenement 3 to 5 stories tall if you're on a wide Street which is 75 ft wide or wider every property is eligible and if you're on a narrow street it's corners and so all of these communities will be eligible and the areas that are low density low density multif family like your garden apartment areas and your other lower density three four five family areas they're all going to be eligible for even higher density okay so as you can see in eastern Queens well over a third of Eastern Queens would be affected by this okay so let's talk about this with specifics we just went through the second of the three city of yes proposals the first was for carbon neutrality that was relatively innocuous so we we we didn't really react too much to it it was about building efficiencies solar panels stuff like that okay some of it was good some of it was bad we just kind of said whatever Economic Opportunity 18 proposals did you guys know about this it's about commercial zoning and allowing commercial zoning on every corner of every block on every residential area in the entire city of New York wow okay so we have been fighting that that just went to the city council they're going to vote on this by the end of the month wow 18 proposals the text just for you guys to understand the zoning text that is the law so whatever the department of City Planning is telling you is not the law the law is what's written in this Arcane text how many people here read the text 1127 Pages no no I did yeah multiple times multiple times three three times page to page and then back and back because that's what needs to happen to see what they're saying and what's actually happening this was a slide that the chair of the City Planning Commission showed during his hearing and I want to make this very clear community board 13 along with nine other boards there are 14 Community boards and queens 10 voted no no not just no no like no hell no and thank and and the and the four that voted yes all voted yes with conditions meaning if they weren't met if those conditions weren't met then then it becomes a no okay so at the City Planning Commission this slide comes up and the the chair says look we had the most Outreach of any meetings we've ever had 175 meetings with Community boards no one's ever done this before that comes out to by the way three meetings per board there are 59 Community boards in the city so three meeting per board where they spent an hour and we have the chair of board 11 here who can confirm this an hour making a presentation reading off of a piece of paper saying are there any questions and then handing them a checklist and saying please vote Yes No modify and give comments and vote on this am I more or less correct exactly yes okay so remember Community boards for all of their imperfect nature they're the closest thing we have to kind of a towns town meeting right and they're advisory only and they're filled with volunteers they're not like they're not like me Mr nerd who knows this stuff right they're people who know a little bit and sometimes that's a little bit of knowledge is actually more dangerous than than not but they try their best luckily in Queens we were able to get those boards who knew what was going on to just tell them no four out of five Bor presidents recommended to approve with conditions well when they were asked by several council members how did the Community boards vote well 21 voted with conditions which means 38 voted no no okay so and and the ones who voted yes half of them didn't have their conditions met so about 85% of the boards are a noo and they went right through us right right through the community boards right through the community and how people feel about this let's talk about what this means this is the slide that they show the community boards what is it one sentence they show a picture of a building 160 in corner stores create a process to allow for small new bodegas and other locally serving storefronts in residential areas when I question them I would say what's the need we have retail strips that are struggling you just came here and said we have a 12% vacancy rate in community board 13 why would we want to encourage corner stores now oh that this is the response it'll never happen well then why are you proposing it okay let me show you what they showed to the Department of City uh to the city council they showed them actual information not a one- sentence thing this is still not great but at least it's more specific okay create a CPC authorization do you know what that means City Planning Commission authorization they would be the sole the sole decision maker as to whether someone could put up to 25 sare ft on any property within a corner of any block anywhere in the city of New York okay community board approval so again the council members said community board approval well they're only advisory right oh but we would pay great attention to them and so they went over and over and they finally reaffirmed no they're advisory only so because the council people said well if they vote no does that mean you're going to vote no and of course he refused to commit to that in addition environmental review the one thing they say is that it quote will not produce objectionable effects there's no environmental review and in fact the city passed the law the mayor passed another law a month ago without the council he didn't need it called Green FastTrack you ever hear of it no of course you didn't green FasTrack is getting rid of environmental review for all small projects you know what the number is one 175 units or less wow that's a small project there is no oversight there is no environmental review okay so what I did was I actually went out and I started looking how this was going to affect neighborhoods so just bear with me Throgs Neck these are your current areas this is uh East cremont Avenue in throg neck throg neck is a very Suburban part of Bronx whoever isn't familiar with it nice place this is what happen oops every one of the areas in purple is a potential location for a 2500 ft retail office commercial or storefront and these are all residential areas with no commercial overlay okay here's City Island City Island Avenue okay canari how many people are familiar with canari you have Flatlands Avenue Rockway Parkway right those are your main commercial areas take a look at this wow wow okay Georgetown Bergen Beach Mill Basin just to the west of there same thing you have the areas with a few commercial overlays okay Ridgewood you think of Ridgewood very urban place lots of commercial areas lots of commercial overlays well it's going to look like that okay Q Gardens you all know Q Gardens Metropolitan and lefs okay farest Hills Gardens who here doesn't know farest tills G one of the most beautiful places in the whole city that area as farest tills Gardens that's Metropolitan Avenue Yellowstone Boulevard South of the railroad tracks wow the basley section of South Jamaica right great neighborhood single and two family homes mostly you have the two areas I think that's suin and uh I forgot which that one is I think that's Rockway Parkway as well there you go and then Howard Beach Howard Beach Cross Bay Boulevard lyndenwood Shopping Center around the old train station wow okay and these areas are where Garden Apartments are which will all be allowed to have infill I I see that council member Nasha Williams has shown up would you like to speak or would you like me to continue on no I'll just say actually I'm sorry hello everybody good afternoon um I was not formerly invited to this meeting so I apologize it wasn't on my calendar but I wanted to stop by as everyone may know I live right up the block I hear the concerns and I just really encourage everyone to reach out to our office and work with us I definitely can do everything by myself um especially I see we're presenting on city of yes I want to tell you guys my issues with ads and TOS I'm in the minority a lot of people my colleagues feel very much the one support of this so I really need the help from the community I feel like I want to be collaborative I am a collaborative person but I also need the help so I'm hoping that folks reach out to me reach out to my office thank you and I know there's been talks about the shelter I know that the congressman was at the community board meeting on Monday Echo his same sentiments I've been having tons of conversations with the mayor's office I actually wrote a letter a month ago talking about my issues with the shelter and how this is unacceptable um and I actually added adus and TOS in my letter and I said we're asking this community to do a lot and now you're talking about a shelter this is very problematic um and so they still have not responded back to my letter but I have had verbal conversations and they have confirmed that a shelter is not coming but I have not done a public announcement because they have not given it to me in writing everybody know why you haven't heard anything from the formal because until they put it in writing we don't know and people don't trust government and even though I'm a council member I'm not going to trust what they say until I get in so I just want to let you guys known that and I hope you enjoyed the rest of your day but I'm right on Lyon Boulevard 172nd Street um okay everybody knows my office cool come up thank you leadership [Applause] and and and just just briefly on the shelter because I'm very aware of it I was actually on the Cambria Heights Zoom which is how this all kind of started about 3 weeks ago we looked at the Buildings Department data while I was on that meeting and it very clearly said this is a nonprofit that's got a contract with DHS it said it right there we we're not making it up and so for this for the mayor's office to come back and say oh there's not going to be a shelter there cafeteria in the basement transi sleeping accommodations that's not a shelter really that's always been what a shelter has been to me so I don't want to get off track cuz I think that's going to come up next so let me continue with this because this is I know it's a lot okay so uh part of part of their proposal has to do with those Garden Apartments you know think of the great Garden Apartments we have in Queens Clearview Gardens uh lauron Gardens uh Bay Terrace Etc well they would all those green spaces they want all those green spaces to disappear Okay so let's let's take a look at at their argument well they came out with a press release about that commercial piece this is the press release okay and I'm just going to switch to two pages forward this is about how wonderful the city of yes is economic right after pass about uh beginning of March notice this point create a process to allow new corner stores in residential areas as approximately 265,000 New Yorkers currently live in areas where a new corner store store could not be located within a qu mile of their home sounds like a lot of people right okay 265,000 people well this is a map of community board a okay so here's Jamaica states holliswood you have a Jamaica Hill Brierwood over here Q Gardens Hills a big chunk of its own single family a large part of his two family okay these are the areas in gray that are within a quar mile so it's interesting look at the areas that aren't in Jamaica States and Hollis okay so the press release there's the quote and that that 265,000 people is 3% of the population of New York City 3% and of course it's mostly in Suburban neighborhoods like our own we don't want a corner store on every corner correct okay just check it I figured but just check it so it's a it's there's another reason behind this right so let's let's investigate what the reason is okay so here's a very high up view of Jamaica State's hollwood R12 r2a what you guys have in Fresh Meadows right R4 r3x is a two family zone r4a two family Zone Etc but mostly single family let's take a look classic Street in Jamaica States you guys know Jamaica States pretty well winding streets big houses some too big and uh and lots of trees and grass these are all the locations just in this little piece where a commercial store for to go okay that's just a a very quick analysis now let's take let's take a building because we're I'm going to show this to you and then I'm going to show you camria Heights because because this is Jamaica States so the reason I did is that on the Camry Heights Zoom people were writing in the chat box why do I care about Jamaica States what's going on with Cambria Heights and I said and and Brian block was the president of Camry H Civic said this is going to happen everywhere so so that kind of keep people tamped down but I wanted to show this because it's a good example here's a big piece of property one of the big houses in Jamaica State beautiful property right hous is about 3,000 sare ft property is 16,800 square huge property here's the present zoning here's the present zoning one family only 5700 minimum lot size 5700 Square ft r2a is 3,800 Square ft right you need a 40 foot wide 3,800 square feet they need a 60 foot wide 5700 square feet .5 F AR floor area ratio that's the size of the building to the size of the property if you have a 10,000 foot lot you can build a 5,000 foot house more or less okay and one parking space per unit we're going to talk about that too so here's what this gentleman could do or gentle woman could do now you back up some so we can see over here thank you uh here's what you can do and and sir just to let you know we've we have this online so anybody who didn't see this it's already online and I think it's going to be online again so I I just want to make that very clear I apologize it's kind of awkward so I get it um so so this property here they could just sever off the back of that property to build that one family house next to it today okay 37 to % law coverage for that property well under the the general proposal this is just the Baseline this is what would be allowed in all of our neighborhoods as a baseline three units per property instead of 60 ft wide now it's 50 ft wide instead of 5700 4750 they they're calling this District fixes District fixes is Middle uh middle uh I forget what that I'm blanking on the term but but basically middle housing again those three to six story apartment buildings um gentle density that's another one they're using all of these the propaganda is off the charts folks seriously I've been doing this for 30 years I've never seen anything like what's going on here okay so here's the Baseline now you have a 75 F no parking requirement all all parking regulations will be eliminated for all new residential development in the city of New York whether it's one family or 300 units they don't care because because wait wait wait for it cars are evil and people who drive cars you're very evil very evil that's the that's the public rhetoric do you know what the actual reason is because if a developer let's say a developer is an R six Zone that's a pretty high density Zone they build a 40 unit building they need to put in 20 parking spaces they need a 50% on site so what do they do they build a big garage underground right now they don't have to build any parking spaces you know how much each of those parking spaces costs the developer $50,000 per space so now and that's a low estimate it's it's closer to 70 but I'm I'm going with 50 50 time 20 is a million bucks so this guy is either pocketing an extra million dollars or he's saving a million dollars on his program so at the end of the day he's going to profit from it anyway I was at a community board meeting community board five masth Middle Village Glendale on Wednesday and City Planning sat there and I posited the same question to them and they said oh that's not going to happen they're going to build more housing I said look I deal with developers Every Day Developers want to squeeze every dime that they can get by by doing the fastest most efficient way and you know in a way I don't blame them it's business for them right so why would they want to build more units particularly in a sub basement in some cases that which will never happen anyway but that's part of their proposal as basements and sellers right why would they do that oh no no no no they're definitely going to do it they're going to do it this is again the propaganda that's being described and by the way at at a meeting uh in uh a a another meeting about this a few days ago they said well are those adus going to be affordable housing nope what about the transit nope the apartment building there is no affordable housing in any of the low density areas this is Mark this is to replace owner occupied homes with market rate rentals that's it that is the entire thrust of this program Okay so there is a quote unquote affordability thing that they want to put in the higher density but all it does is give them another 20% bonus it's nothing so so let's see what happens if you're in a Transit Zone because now this is just the op this is just the Baseline right and you see the lot coverage doubles right the buildings double they want to get rid of all Green Space by the way we don't have any flooding problems right there's no flooding here no no flooding problems okay just just just checking yeah okay that's what's going to happen in a Transit Zone because what they're going to do is they're going to introduce something that doesn't exist in single family zones right now the dwelling unit Factor again all this stuff I don't expect you to know or remember it frankly but all of this stuff has meaning what's a dwelling unit Factor if you got a 10,000 foot lot they divide it by that number to figure out how many units you can have so right now there is no dwelling unit Factor because you need a 6,000 squ a 5700 square foot lot with a 60 by you know 60 ft wide 0.5 and it can only have one house on it one single family home now because it's multif family in this new Transit Zone which covers a third of Queens not you but Queens Village rosale Laurelton all your communities around you are going to have this they now have this number 500 so you divide 16 ,800 by 500 you get a 33 unit apartment building wow but don't worry there's no parking there's no parking and they'll let you have up to 100% lock coverage on the corners now here's where the commercial happens remember I said the 2500 square ft well now the developer says you know what I'm going to pull a few of those units out and I want to put a 2500 square ft retail store on that first floor that's in yellow right there that's what this corner store proposal is it is not to give people a corner store in places that don't have access this Works hand in hand hand in hand with what this proposal is okay here briefly campus commercial this is what I was talking about before so here they show a picture of a Nicha building and they say enable resident serving retail services and maker spaces at Nicha other residential campuses right that's not what it says any property 1.5 Acres or more in the city of New York in a residential Zone would be allowed to have up to 15,000 square ft of commercial on the ground floor they could build new or they could put it into an existing building and very clearly again it's up to City Planning it's their decision nobody else's to authorize this so let's take a look at Bayside I did a little thing for basa this is bell bell and Northern commercial areas are in red to the West is this area called bide Manor it's a little garden apartment complex you might be familiar with it like a block or two west of bell nice place rental the reason I picked rental is co-ops get a little more sticky because it would be a decision of the board but this is owned by one person or one entity and they could easily act on this so um so uh here's here's the area these yellow areas are Gardens right these are the gardens currently you can build a 33t building and it's already pretty much maxed out like it's pretty hard for them to build on that but with the change in zoning they'll immediately be able to go to 45 ft as a minimum the F will raise up then if you're in a Transit Zone it goes to a 1.5 so now you can build even denser and then if you're in the new campus Zone you can go to 55 ft and you can put a commercial up to 15,000 feet on the first floor okay so that kind of gives you an idea what's going on let me briefly now that we've done this now that I've scared you all let me show you sorry nope that's not it where is it what did I do with it sorry my apologies here here we go so these are some of the slides from the city of yes a little bit more housing in every neighborhood allow for missing middle housing including Town Center zoning trans and oriented apartment buildings help homeowners by providing additional flexibility and allowing accessory dwelling units lift costly parking mandates for new housing and enable conversion small and shared apartments in infill okay so these are beautiful examples of how you know how pretty all of this is going to work and how new units aren't going to create any additional anything and by the way also no spending on infrastructure no sewers no water no police no fire no schools nothing no no libraries right and this just kind of gives you an idea of the way they're drawing this but again it's I I I it's all now remember in the first part we talked about how 20 years ago they said that your your community was doing this because it was mostly compliant 80% most of your houses are between 900 and 1100 square ft right they're capes they're one and a half story capes most of them the current zoning on a 40 by 100 you can build 2300 square feet so anybody can double the size of their home today well they had the nerve to show this picture and they said well you know let's talk about the r41 Zone that's a semi-attached one and two family Zone these buildings which were built before 1961 they couldn't be built today why well they don't meet all of the different indices that that would allow them so they're stuck and again we know because 80 to 90 to 95% of these areas were rezoned in the last 20 years and yes we knew a few people were going to be stuck quote unquote but that happens everywhere this is normal okay so if you have a th buildings and 900 of them are compliant that's that's pretty normal well they're saying this this is the reason they're doing it that's the reason they're getting rid of our basic regulations Town Center every single commercial overlay in R1 through R5 zones all of our low density zones will be allowed to have two to four story apartment buildings like lyen Boulevard Transit oriented development I told you that again there's Queens Village addley Park Springfield Gardens Laurelton rosale so you're going to be surrounded on all sides by transit zones and this is this is what I'm because I'm going to show you a slide of this they are going to allow any religious group anywhere in the city to develop high density housing even if they're not in a Transit zone so think Sacred Heart okay and I'm going to show you what that's going to look like here's your end parking mandates they show a you know a cute little sketch of people living and here's those dirty cars in that garage my goodness what a terrible terrible thing um so you know again it it's it would be comical if it wasn't so serious right here's Cambria Heights you are primarily single family r2a most of the rest of it is zoned two family detached these are the basic RS I don't need to you know I I can go more into them but I just wanted to show you that's if you took an aerial you flew over that is Cambria Heights right there right I mean that's about as perfect a picture as there is okay your two family you have your r3a these are the the smaller houses that are still detached but but they're smaller a lot of them are one family some of them are two family okay you have the semi-attached house you have a few areas with these just a few blocks from here right and you have your row houses your beautiful row houses you have a bunch of them here gorgeous row houses and then you have a few small areas where multif family development can happen on lyen on Springfield and and on Francis leis B you have the c81 Zone that's Auto Repair okay and then have your commercial overlays which cover Lyon most of Lyon a little bit of Springfield and a little bit of Francis Lewis so this is one family zoning this is two and the Orange is two family and the red is multif family that would all become three unit minimum for all of those areas and the red is still multif family okay so again I just went through all of these just to show you I did my homework here guys thank you okay here's your town center zoning here's okay this is around uh not too far from here it's a few blocks from here okay that's what would happen you see the bottom slide that would be as of right this is not a zoning change where if someone wanted to do that today they would have to come to the community board and the council person Etc and say could we do this to reone and there would be arguments and it would or wouldn't happen now it's as of right if you're on a commercial overlay you can build that okay here's Sacred Heart Sacred Heart okay there's your property of Sacred Heart obviously this property is mostly a parking lot perfect location for a new four-story building to go there and I estimate it would be around somewhere around 50 units okay so I want you to look at this slide this is in their presentation a little more housing in every neighborhood do you notice where most of that is take a look Eastern Queens the darker green Northeast and Southeast Queens we are expected to shoulder the brunt of this new proposal more than anywhere else in the city you can see it right this is their their statement so we have four outcomes here outcome number one get 26 no votes we have 51 council members we need 2 six no votes to kill this thing number two 26 yes votes happen and we live with it whatever the consequences 26 yes votes and we sell our homes and the fourth is get assembly Bill 9417 passed which would allow communities like Cura Heights if they wanted to to remove themselves from the city of New York if they believe that the city is going in a direction that they do not want okay that is a big lift that is a big issue but I can assure you that I've now given over 80 presentations and at every Civic group what did uh um Alicia say say at the beginning we pay more in taxes okay I want to show you a picture here look at this picture see all the dark blue yeah okay that's how ownership we are owner occupied we have your your your Council a community board district has the highest in Queens it's over 73% owner occupied okay second only to the southern part of Staten Island all right uh Northeast Queens here is uh board 11 is 71% but we're well above the city average throughout Queens Queens is like 50% homeowners and this the average across the city is oneir okay so I want you to look at this this is from Brad Lander the controller he put this out last year you see all the blue you see what this says we're paying 300 to 400% property tax rates as the richest parts of the city Greenpoint Williamsburg Manhattan Brownstone Brooklyn these are we are subsidizing the city and the city doesn't want our communities to exist the largest portion of the budget the largest portion is single family homes we are actually paying the largest portion of the property taxes in the city of New York I did not know this six months ago so this is all new to me and I'm a home I'm a homeowner too right so the fact that we are subsidizing the very people who are trying to destroy us is extremely disturbing right so I started looking at these other towns in Nassau and in Westchester and I realized our communities are paying way more per square foot than they are yes it's everybody oh naso's so expensive if you look at Rockville Center you look at Garden even Garden City and you see what they're charging for property taxes and the amount they're spending on Services per person we we are off the charts so I already looked at Cambria Heights I looked at Cambria Heights and Cambria Heights is is the money you're supposed to per person is above Rockville Center it's above Garden City and what are you getting for those Services nothing nothing so again desperate times call for desperate measures yes and for every person who says Ah that's never going to happen or that's something that we can't do well then why has every other town and Village been able to do it in the state of New York obviously some places are better positioned than others but I I made up this map that shows we have 43 potential towns in Queens because High home ownership High income levels that can support themselves Cambria Heights you're 32 you're number 32 not just not in any particular order you're you are uh no not 32 sorry you're number 34 78.6% home ownership 7,000 units 20,000 people well what's going to happen if we do that well the way we wrote the Bill if you are able to do this the city will have to give you the ability to share Services if you wish like sewer and water which of course you have to share maybe for a short period of time your schools and your police and fire but you negotiate with them and when you're ready to set that up then you can break that contract with the city that's the whole point and we wrote it that way so that the city couldn't come back and try to screw you over if you wanted to do this so I urge you and and then I'm going to turn it over and there's you know I don't know how you want to structure it but I urge you all to talk to your senators and assembly members the session ends June 30th it is critical we couldn't do anything about this prior to the budget being done and the budget was just done a week and a half ago so we have a very short window it's very important that the message is out that we cannot take this right the city say no to the city of yes right we know that but the state people they always the state and the city always compartmental well that's a state issue that's a city issue this is a universal issue and if the state reps do not respond to you they're up for election right now and that's not a threat I'm just letting you know they're up for election now and the council and the mayor they're all running for reelection the minute this thing is over literally and that's the only Power and leverage that we have as residents and voters so on that note I'm going to turn it over thank you everyone I want to thank you I know very lengthy and um people upstairs I apologize them again and again because we were thinking that they we can stream it upstairs because upstairs is just as crowded as down here maybe more [Music]
