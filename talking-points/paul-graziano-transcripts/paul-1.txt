so that our voices can be heard on the mayor city of yes plan in order for each of us to be able to form an opinion and decide what we'd like to do it's important to first understand what is proposed and what is St at stake here for us but just know that this affects the entire city it affects neighborhoods not just in Queens but across the five burrows the economic portion alone just to give you some sense of what people have attempted to plow through the economic portion alone which is the part that I'll talk about um is 1,157 Pages the housing portion which Our Guest Paul gratiano is going to discuss in a bit is longer than than that we're not expected to understand we're not expected to be able to get through it and handle it or stop it but here we are and as I say the meeting's being filmed just so you know so the purpose of our meeting tonight is to introduce Clarity we have a special guest this evening to help with that I've invited Paul Graziano to join us and he has kindly agreed even canceled something for us tonight um Paul is a longtime Civic activist a long lifelong resident of queens has a master's degree in urban Affairs and planning from Hunter College where I also went he has taken on too many Community battles to count but he is always on the right side of things and a strong defender of neighborhoods just like ARS he has a presentation for us on the housing portion of city of yes and we'll speak in a bit so tonight is a bit like school and I'm very sorry about that um there won't be a quiz but this is what what's expected of us with the length and complexity of these proposals we have to dig down on some kind possibly boring subjects but it's worth it um I'm going to run through the economic portion and also explain a bit about zoning zoning is the key to understanding the city of yes plans that threaten one and two family neighborhoods essentially we have actions we'd like you to take but it's essential that you want understand first so zoning the farest community and civic association rezoned our neighborhood just about 20 years ago why and I'm talking about the area from Dartmouth to Union Turnpike and from ascan Avenue to roughly Selfridge why did we down Zone our neighborhood because we would drive around former president Barbara suchinsky and I would drive around on a Saturday we both live on the same block and we'd see areas that looked like ours with a lot of strange construction going on what did we see businesses in the middle of the block tacked onto houses Every Which Way businesses in tucked into Corner houses obviously with signage you could tell houses being built extended back extend extending the property line to The Back Fence going out this way to the side property lines and also going up blocking sunl and towering over the neighborhoods and not to mention increasing density so single and uh single and double family houses were suddenly like housing you know four different families pave overs of front Gardens to provide sidewalk parking was also happening blocking pedestrian paths so there'd be the gardens with cars this way that way the other way a senior or somebody with a baby carriage couldn't get down the street this happens to be illegal right now just so you know because it's considered green space it's illegal since like 1929 because they knew that we needed our Gardens to um collect rain water to prevent flooding so yeah all kinds of pave overs so we realize the Civic realized like what's going on in these other areas why is this able to happen and what about our area so we realize we better look at our zoning so we looked at our zoning and what we discovered was that like the whole back door was open on us because our zoning at that time allowed for like tear Downs of our houses and construction of apartment buildings like seven stories so as a result of that we took the necessary steps to Zone our area here the confines of which I just told you and essentially you need to understand that the process by which we did it wasn't Abracadabra we just changed our zoning no it's a highly specific official process through specific paperwork and documentation that has to be filled out it has to go through zoning and planning of the community board community board itself Queen City Planning and City Planning so it's completely approved it was okay officially okay we didn't make it up so this is the key to understanding all aspects of city of yes city of yes is a truckload of proposals that rest on the principle of destroying wall zoning particularly in one and two family neighborhoods like our own there would no longer be Community review of projects and all projects which I will describe in a moment would be termed as of right as of right means rubber stamp okays for things we don't want okay here are some nuts and bolts the economic portion has 18 proposals they're all over the lot and there are ones that I'm not going to talk about some of them have to do with like you know like micro delivery of Amazon packages uh loading base of new construction things like that I have no problem with any of that but the ones that I'm concerned about and also are in a letter that I would ask people to sign if they would be willing to are the ones that have to do with for example in a corner house being able to put a bodega that's the term that the department of City Planning uses to put a bodega or a store or a business in a corner house using 2500 square fet of that house imagine the deliveries for all that is sold in a convenience store like that imagine the foot and car traffic hours of operation perhaps they have lotto maybe they need then they need a cash machine and what if commercial garbage hauling so the City Council Claims they may not go ahead with this particular proposal right now everything is draft and very Wishy washing and who knows we have no guarantees and we must be heard and must oppose it second problem proposal is allowing businesses to be run out of homes in the middle of a block at the moment you can use 25% of your home for that purpose but city of yes proposes that 49% of a house in the middle of the block can be used as a business you can have three employees and it expands the categories that are allowable and the ones that they keep talking about are nail nails salon barber shop hairdresser when do people go to the hairdresser and get their nails done at night and all day Saturday and Sunday so a lot of us share common driveways do we really want this the foot and car traffic from that the lack of privacy for Neighbors adjacent to a home used that way would be unacceptable now in case there are folks here who also live in apartment buildings I want to touch on two other proposals for apartment dwellers one would allow Commercial Business activity now you know when you walk along an apartment building there's businesses on the ground floor right the city of yes wants to allow commercial activity on the second floor okay the fire department is completely freaking out about that they're not happy and then the other proposal is that bars and restaurants be able to be located on the top of apartment buildings now as I say I I can talk about that in a minute but anyway I know we have to laugh this just kind of makes you want to kill yourself basically yeah um so the thing is that they can revise they can do this they can change the number of employees in the middle of the block to two from three which is what they're possibly talking about because they know that neighborhoods are flipped out about it but here's the bottom line it destroys our protective zoning the minute any of those uses come in it de facto removes our residential status and changes us to mixed use allowing commercial development now Paul's going to get into the separate housing portion and then your hair is really going to stand on end but this is just the economic development portion that would affect houses so what I've done as we could trying to come up with some action plans here so what I've done is I have written a letter to Lynn Schulman cc to members of the city council speaker Adrien Adams who's in love with this plan uh Senator adabo and also Senator assembly man heesy because there's a lot of this sort of plan coming through Albany as well to let them know how we feel and I'm just going to summarize um essentially this letter come this is to Lynn the letter our councilwoman here in 29 District 29 the letter comes to you today to address an urgent matter as you know the city council is preparing to vote the week of May 20 which we just found out and that's why you're all here on the economic portion of the city of yes plan you will cast a vote while revisions to the plan have been suggested by the zoning Professionals of the city council the proposals tied to neighborhoods zoned as residential must either be stricken entirely from the plan or you must cast a no vote on the plan as a whole then specifically I say all current zoning covering are of one and two family homes now classified as residential must remain in place zoning must not be changed de facto to mixed use and then I go into the detail about the fact that we changed our own zoning and we did it the right way so what are you messing around for um these current zoning designations must remain in place they are not out of date because the plan keeps referring to the fact that zoning around New York City happened in 1960 and is in completely out of date that's not true I did it about 22 years ago and unfortunately for them I didn't drop dead and I can still say I did I keep telling them sorry I'm still here so anyway and I even fail my paperwork the other day and all the photos that I took um okay and then I say the corner stores okay must not be allowed under any circumstances if allowed only real estate speculators will benefit and community comedy and neighbor neighborliness cooperation quality of life and safety will be severely impacted and then about commercial deliveries and everything we don't want it and then as to businesses located midblock I say absolutely not no way and then also say that the uh impact on surrounding homes from those midblock businesses would be absolutely impossible to bear so and this is to let her understand that we we know that there's Financial difficulty economic difficulty in the city right now we're not uncaring people okay because we get accused of that every time we object to something we're told oh you know we're all whatever um I don't know lack empathy I don't know as to outcome economic revitalization of our business cars is important since many stores now stand empty therefore there's no reason to begin to site business activity within areas zoned as residential okay okay just a little more and then you've got him okay it amounts to New York City Government overreach demolishes the principles of community review agency and self-determination discredits property rights and disrespects the knowledge base that neighborhood people possess of their own areas to buy and maintain a home in this city is a brave and optimistic Choice involving consider able sacrifice the way of life we have chosen must not be destroyed we do not wish to urbanize our residential neighborhoods because our community board six has people on it that voted in favor of all of this and they think we need to be urbanized but we don't okay this is a once in a generation vote it is essential that you as our council person vote the will of your constituents we will firmly support you as you support our residential neighborhoods to reiterate you must vote no on the economic portion of the city of yes unless the plan is dramatically revised to protect current zoning so this is the letter and as you're all going if you choose to there's a way of signing you know how you identify yourself on a petition so we're going to make a petition out of these and so at the end when everybody's saying goodbye we can do that now I'm going to introduce Paul and Paul has a special presentation for us on the housing portion but are there any like small question in the meantime because we'll take questions at the end quickly some of us from cb6 have been reson to Bob Holden's yeah area so can you send that letter to him as well yes I will I well it's going to all Council people okay yeah no thank you very much could you also add the buau president because he seems to be a very big proponent okay well I'll write him in that you're right you're absolutely right and that's a complete oversight on my part he's the one that also assigns the members to the community board right pres she's absolutely no she's she's right and it's an oversight on my part and than thank goodness real estate developers appointed to the cd6 in the past few years yeah we know and they they come here from Manhattan because they want to make this like well let me you you had I you know I wanted to Once PA but let me just say in general um you know I'm a bit of a geek I'm a journalist and I do research and I find out all kinds of wacky stuff so this plan is an insult to New Yorkers because New York should develop its own plants this stuff comes from places like California argon Houston and all the rest of it so it just sort of swept across the country and got picked up here some of the zoning some of the Department of City Planning people making the presentations at the community boards one woman is actually from Oregon and she only lives here for two years so why is she telling us how we're supposed to live so anyway but I do want to get to Paul because uh if you think mine's intense my what I'm telling you is intense this is really and Pa [Applause] St can everyone hear okay can you hear me we can hear him and you we can't hear these people's comments you need to repeat what they say but we can't hear it okay sir make sure that when people speak I will repeat them I think everyone can hear me yes yes yes my wife says I have a resonant voice I think she just means I'm loud so hi I'm Paul graciano and uh thanks for having me here tonight and it's a great crowd um I am I am going to talk a little bit about the commercial and I'll go into a little more detail because we're going to talk about not just the nuclear bomb that is the city of yes for housing opportun but how The Economic Opportunity piece is really not a separate part of this it was done in several packages but they actually are the same thing and they intertwine with each other and I think it's very very important for the public to understand that so let me give you just a brief background of how we have come to this point um and just briefly I'm I'm from flushing I've lived there my whole life I live on the same block I've lived on my whole life I live next door to my parents home booy okay okay so so um about as as CLA was saying about 25 years ago really 30 years ago there was a real movement across the city for neighborhoods to help better protect themselves from outdated zoning which is what they're calling the zoning we have now which is not but the zoning that was put in place in 1961 we had a zoning resolution for the City of New York okay and we still operate under that but there has been huge uh amendments to that over the years so starting in the 90s many of you probably remember how many how many of you have lived here since the 90s okay 80s 70s 60s okay so we all right so 50s 40s 30 yeah I I got it so I I've been I've lived in my community since the day I was born so that's 1971 so that that should tell you how old I am um when we uh started doing this when I was in my 20s um the zoning that was in place from 1961 wasn't really matching communities they were very broad so we started seeing as Claudia was saying a lot of demolitions of houses and and neighborhoods all over the city going hm how could that happen that was a that was a one family neighborhood oh no no it's actually Z R six R six allows for very tall apartment buildings so there was a real movement to do this from the Civic organizations in particular and queen Queens was definitely the leader on this um I I can just say that for sure because I was involved um and finally about 20 25 years ago it really picked up steam and during the Bloomberg Administration we had what I could call a willing partner with the Department of City Planning to look at our communities and do real community-based planning for the first time in the history of the city as far as I know and all of the communities that were reson and most of Queens was rezoned I I'll just tell you that I was involved in almost every single contextual reasoning that was done the community was deeply deeply involved did they get everything they wanted no did they get most of what they wanted in most cases yes were their tradeoffs often times so for example Austin Street got upzoned dramatically but that was because this area on the other side were down zoned or contextually rezoned so there was a balance that was done so any any elected official and any propagandist that we're dealing with today in city government is just not telling the truth we we were really careful fine grained approach building by building lot by lot starting about 3 and a half years ago there was a concerted effort to turn this all upside down this is a and Claudia was right this is a national Trend there are people and communities across the country and political forces and real estate forces in particular that want to eliminate single family zoning and to family zoning densify everywhere get rid of cars all all of these things and mostly for the benefit of the developers even though they painted as being for Humanity okay so let's let's just be honest about it three and a half years ago we had a speaker named Corey Johnson do you guys remember him okay so it was right before uh the holidays in December and I remember turning on the news and going huh what's he doing there I've never seen him on a press conference before and he said everybody I've come up with a solution to all of our hous problems and I have just introduced the best new land use plan in the history of New York City it's called planning together okay so being the Curious planner that I am I looked at this plan plan I said that in quotations the plan was to eliminate single family zoning across the city of New York and force every community board to upzone every decade in perpetuity and if the the council person and the community board couldn't agree on which area to sacrifice there would be a new City Planning above the current City Planning and the I called him a wizard of OAC character who would designate an area for you so myself and a woman named Renee Hill who is the former chair of community board 12 and head of the Addle Park civic association we created a group and we went and hit most of the community boards when these hearings were happening in early 2021 of course this was during covid it was all zoom zoom meetings Etc but we got the vast majority of community boards to say what what the heck is this right and there was one public hearing and the whole thing died and it turns out he was using that as a platform to run for controller he ran against Brad Lander well Brad Lander is the controller not Cory Johnson so an upset then we had a new governor h so she came in and the first thing she did in 2022 in her State of the State address is she said one line and again I'm also like Claudia a bit of a nerd let's let's face it I'm watching the State of the State address you know the hundred people who aren't in government watching it and she says one line and the line is we're going to get rid of outdated zoning laws that are holding back housing in the state of New York so once again I look at her report and what does it say eliminate single family zoning in the entire state of New York forced every municipality in the state of New York to allow accessory dwelling units adus we're going to talk about those tonight take away home rule which is enshrined in the state constitution we are one of the few states where actually local government has as much power as state government it's a very we live in a pretty weird State Most states most States the state government has much more power than the local government but in New York it's pretty 50/50 and uh Transit oriented development increasing density near originally just Metro North and long railroad stations but then all subway stations and blanket amnesty for all illegal conversions in the city of New York and a lot of other things but those are the things that caught my attention right I live in a neighborhood similar to this in flhy so that should tell you everything so I created a group called save one family New York and I started contacting not just people and queens who I know and in Staten Island and Brooklyn and the Bronx but also NASA suff Westchester Rockland Ithaca Buffalo Rochester you name it and in a month we got her to take everything out except for the blanket amnesty for illegal conversions which was eventually pulled out of the she stuffed it all into the budget this is what she tries to do she's stuffing legislation into the budget which is totally wrong so we got that out I warned everybody and I'm a nonpartisan person I said if she is reelected in 2022 this is coming back last year you might have heard of something called the housing compact anybody anybody anybody one person okay well it was all over the news remember the budget was late like 30 days last year yeah there were two reasons bail reform and the housing compact because what she wanted to do was everything the year before plus Force every municipality to increase housing Supply every single year in perpetuity and if they didn't do it then the state would come in and designate areas just like that Wizard of Oz to up Zone and build new housing so we worked with our Senators and assembly members and they refused to sign off on this and she refused to to stop and finally she gave in when they walked out of negotiations and that was when she finally capitulated it came back again this year you guys probably don't even know this she tried to legalize the basements and sellers again this year and the only reason that it didn't happen is that several assembly members and Senators particularly from Queens assembly member at bronstein neie rosik uh Alicia Hinman and Senator Leeward comery and others told them we will not sign off on this unless you create a program that doesn't make every community board allow this so they created a pilot program there is one community board in Queens where this might happen that's Long Island City in Sunnyside and my resp is save travels right the other 13 boards here don't want this and most of the boards in the city also don't want it so now we get to the city of yes the mayor came up with this plan within the first week of coming into office he created a group called The blast committee he's very good at acronyms um and slogans when he was the burough president of Brooklyn his slogan was build baby build okay the blast committee followed by a list that the blast Committee created the blast committee was made up of all of his biggest contributors and donors construction companies developers housing groups big commercial groups Etc they came out with a list of about 120 items a wish list called get stuff built that was literally the name of it and most of that today is the city of yes that's what we're dealing with a wish list from developers that may become reality and if this happens we're done and I say that in all seriousness I'm not trying to be dramatic but this truly is an Extinction event for all of our communities and the rest of the state is watching what happens to us because the governor has promised that if the city of yes passes in New York City she will bring this to every other corner of the state she has stated this publicly the mayor and the department of City Planning have stated publicly that low density neighborhoods are the cause of the housing crisis in New York City they have stated publicly contextual zoned neighborhoods like Forest Hills like where I live in North flushing like other places Cambria and in southeast queens that should have never happened it was a mistake because it took away the ability to build wherever you want and in fact the zoning resolution itself was a mistake because it stopped apartment buildings from being built in one and two family zones so today I'm going to talk to you about the five biggest pieces to this this document as as Claudia said the first part of this was actually called carbon neutrality that was was passed in December and that had to do with building efficiencies and new technology and energy efficiencies some of that was okay some of it wasn't some of it was pretty bad but it it was sort of separate from the rest the economic piece 18 proposals 1127 pages long which I've read backwards and forwards too many times and the current one is 14 separate proposals 1386 pages long anybody who wants to read it let me know I'll be happy to give it to so what we are dealing with here as I said is a city that has made it very clear that their ultimate goal is to densify every square inch of the city particularly low density communities we are in the crosshairs okay this was actually on their website and still is on their on their Twitter feed from about ex whatever you want to call it about six months ago and they put up this picture that says 1989 which is supposed to be a play on Taylor Swift which is pretty lame but again those kids from Iowa you know they're coming up with all kinds of things so the the thing that that was said was this quote we've got bad blood with Robert Moses and we've made a lot of progress to improve New York City Zoning but we're not out of the woods yet that's why we're chasing our wildest dreams in city of yes to shake exclusionary zoning off and say once and for all Welcome to New York okay does anybody have any idea how much of New York City is zoned single family anybody any idea take a guess 30% 30% anybody else 20% 5% what 5% it's you're all you're much better than my other audiences they're like 80% 15% 15% and another 9% is zoned to family that means that more than 75% of the city is zoned today multi family right so if you look at a basic [Music] understanding Seattle is 81% single family everything you see in pink or purple a single family okay Chicago 79% Portland 77% Portland where that young woman was from the one from City Planning from two years ago Los Angeles 75% Minneapolis 70% even Washington DC [Music] 36% okay and New York City 15% and where is most of that single family zoning east of the Van Wick Express you guys are a little Enclave in Q Gardens in Richmond Hill and Forest Hills but the vast majority outside of Howard Beach in your little area and a little bit in the Rockway is east of the bwick if you take out east of the Van Wick there's hardly any single family zoning left in the city of New York okay and just to give you an idea and this is what's going to happen here 50% is zoned single family east of the Van Wick another 25% is zoned two family and this will all become a minimum of three families on every parcel and that's what's going to happen here too every parcel of land will be allowed to have three units minimum okay so then there's going to be Transit oriented development and Transit oriented development will allow a apartment buildings on all properties where they are mapped on a wide Street every parcel will be allowed to have an apartment building if it meets a very large lot definition you know what their large lot is 5,000 square ft who lives in a property that's 5,000 square ft anybody who lives in a 4,000 squ 40 by 100 property okay 20 by 100 there you go so it would take basically a developer to buy two or three houses tear them down and be able to build an apartment building on that site okay and if you're on a narrow Street it's a corner but the corner is defined as the corner property in any other property that's attached to it so if someone buys up Eight houses they can do from the corner to that house that's just in eastern queens and you can see a little bit where you guys are these are where the transit zones are M as you can see it's an enormous amount that's just in the one and two family zones today and that's the low density multif family zoning is in blue that's where the transit Zone would be so it's a huge portion of queens that will be affected by this so let's just talk a little bit about Robert Moses generally speaking not the best guy in the world right has some baggage let's say he did some okay things I always say you know we may vilify him but we wouldn't be here without the Jackie Robinson or the Cross Island right we'd be a different place but he was a bit of a tyrant these are some of his quotes your principal error is this to imagine that the people's views are of any importance at all we must Advance their fortunes without having any respect for their opinions sound familiar you can draw any kind of picture you want on a clean slate and indulge your every whim in the wilderness in laying out a new Deli Cana or Brazilia but when you operate in an overbuilt Metropolis you have to hack your way with a Mex and if you elect a matina idle mayor you're going to have a musical comedy Administration so my comments on that is sounds like the Adams Administration sounds like the Adams Administration and sounds like the Adams administ now there was another person who fought against him her name was Jane Jacobs anybody remember that name here okay so you know I always say to people he was not a blackhearted villain and she was not a lily white princess you know it's not that really that black and white on here but she was definitely someone who fought for community and some of you may remember when Robert Moses or heard stories about Robert M is wanting to build an expressway called the Lower Manhattan Expressway that was going to go from the Holland Tunnel to I believe the Manhattan Bridge and they were going to wipe out Tribeca and Soho in the prices now remember Tribeca and Soho at that time was abandoned in the 50s and 60s it was a pretty desolate Place her quote cities grow up they just happen bit by bit hand a city to the planners and they'll make it a desert hand it to the people and they'll make it habitable and as a planner I 100% approve that statement which is we are the ones who should be deciding our future not some people who are trying to impose it upon us okay so this came out three weeks ago The Daily News uh after you read this if does anybody have a subscription to the Daily News here good well if you do you might want to get rid of it after you read this a home for us however what should be dismissed off hand is anything that too heavily emphasizes quote neighborhood character property values or Fring over increased density these tedious arguments tedious are missing the point which is that a lack of housing stock threatens affordability and quality of life in all of New York and there's no way to dodge this by holding firm against development the bucolic character of any particular neighborhood is going to matter little as the current residents are priced out for those who desperately want to live in a suburb I guess that's you guys will remind you that there are several in the immediate vicinity of the five burs this is New York City that is from the editorial board of the daily [Music] news now at the font at the single hearing of the city council on Economic Opportunity which is what Claudia was talking about at the beginning Dan garodnick who's the chair of the City Planning Commission and the guy who his name is Matt and I can never remember his last name but the planner who was in charge of the economic piece were sitting there being questioned by the city council and they went through a presentation that went on for about an hour and at the end the city council was doing this but they showed this slide I thought it was be good for you to see it they were going on and on and on how important it was they had reached out to so many Community boards and there's never been more Outreach we had 175 meetings 17 no one's ever done anything like that before on this Economic Opportunity just to let you know there are 59 Community boards in New York City that's three meetings per board so it's it's not quite as amazing as the way he's describing it and for of five burough presidents recommended to approve with conditions that would be also Donovan Richards one of the four okay what he left out was something very important that the vast majority of boards voted this down okay they voted Economic Opportunity down and they didn't just vote it down they voted it a hell no down okay of the 14 boards in Queens the only boards that voted in favor was your board board 10 Ozone Park and Howard Beach don't know how that happened and Boards one and two Long Island City in atoria which to me makes perfect sense okay but the rest of the boards and queens voted no the Staten Island boards voted no two-thirds of the boards in Brooklyn voted no most of the boards in the Bronx voted no and a number of boards in Manhattan voted no so he left out that very important point that the vast majority of boards were actually opposing to it and even the ones that voted in favor voted with conditions and most of those conditions were not met so their votes turned to no so it's something like 85% of the boards ultimately voted no the department of City Planning ignored all of this and made some minor modifications and said here you go to the city council so let's talk a little bit I'm going to revisit what Claudia said this slide is what they show to the community board this slide a picture and one sentence 16 corner stores create a process to allow for small new bodegas and other locally serving storefronts in residential areas that's not what the text said the text the zoning text it's the only thing that matters That's the Law not this pretty picture with a sentence it said all properties within 100 ft of a corner on every residential Block in every residential Zone in the city of New York can have up to 2500 square ft commercial office storefront retail that is not what this says does am I right or wrong right okay they showed this slide to the city council more information closer to what it was but the main point of this I know it gives sole authority to the City Planning Commission I it takes away even the council which is your elected official from deciding this no environmental review and here it says subject to both environmental review community board approval they were questioned by the council members well if the community board votes this down are you going to vote this down and he hemmed and ha tried to change the subject and finally said the community board is advisory on which which they are Community boards are advisory so here's an example okay this is important for you to understand this is community board eight Jamaica States holliswood briwood H Gard Hills just on the other side of the park I'm sure you're pretty familiar with it about half of it is Zone single family about a quarter of his Zone 2 family the rest of it is lower density mostly uh Garden Apartments multi family the area you see here is one4 of a mile from a commercial Zone anything you see in gray that has to do with a press release that the mayor put out that says the reason we're doing this is because approximately 265,000 New Yorkers currently live in areas where a new corner store could not be located within a quar mile of their home so the area that doesn't have that is deepest Jamaican Estates who certainly I think you would know don't want a COR store and by the way that number 265,000 sounds with like a huge number of people it's 3% of the population of the city of New York 3% and when has the city ever done anything for 3% of the population so this just briefly shows you a map of the zoning it's mostly single family and two family in this area the darker areas are within a quarter mile let's take a quick look at a typical Jamaica States clock looks similar to some of your areas right big houses some are really big houses uh with green lots of trees and green and 30 streets every single Square you see there is where a corner store could be located okay and I have other maps showing entire neighborhoods showing what it looks like today and what it would look like under this proposal including yours which I'm going to show you in a minute so I want to show you how the new housing proposals are going to interface with this commercial proposal So currently Jamaica States is R12 single family 5700 minimum lot size 57 700 ft 60 F wide Lots you can build a single home 0.5 F floor area ratio that's the size of the building to the size of the lot right so if you about 5,000 foot lot you can build a 2500t house that's what the zoning is currently this is a very big piece of property it's got a big house on it 3,000 ft house 16,800 ft lot the guy right now or the the woman who owns this home can sever off one side and build one family home there today on that 60 by 100 right there the lot coverage is about 37 to 40% okay one parking space this is going to be the Baseline give me your phone three homes three two family homes with a either attached accessory dwelling unit or a new house behind your house that will be the Baseline and that will be in your R2 zones that will be in your r3a zones here your R3 D1 your r4b all of the zoning you have today in fars Hills it's the same thing but I'm just showing this because it's very easily to illustrate right it's easy to illustrate this there will be 60% lock coverage it's like double the lock coverage you have today 80% on Corners 75 F so they're immediately giving 50% do you know what they're calling this District fixes District fixes because you know there's some people who own properties and they can't build it to the mass so we're going to bring the zoning down to the lowest common denominator as a district fix so your 40ft wide lot is now going to only need to be 30t wide your 3,800 F feet this is in an R2 Zone only needs to be 2800 sare F feet we'll get rid of your sidey yards we'll get rid of your backyards will increase the floor area as of right we'll get rid of your front yards we'll allow you to build higher we'll get rid of your green space and allow people to pave over everything and we'll get rid of all parking requirements in the city of New York for every new residential building whether it's a one family home or a 300 unit apartment building we're going to get rid of all parking because anybody cars are evil they want you on bikes and people who drive cars are very evil we keep voting these people in that's that's but no no sir that's the public rhetoric the real rhetor the real reason is that every one of those parking spaces that they have to build cost a developer money and the developers who put the mayor in office today said we don't want to build parking we don't want to have to require to build parking because we're losing money by giving that mandatory service to the people who live there so think about it if you live in an R six Zone and you build a 40 unit building you need 20 parking spaces on site each of those parking spaces costs $50,000 so now I'm a developer and they say well I don't have to build I can build the 40 units but I don't need to put any parking in I'm going to pocket that million that's going to be an additional million in profit for me when I confronted the department of City Planning last week about this at at a community board meeting there were respons oh that's not going to happen they'll build more units now I know developers developers are business people and they want to make every penny that they can with the least amount of risk if someone gives them a freebie they're going to take it okay so now I've shown you the Baseline this is what's going to happen if you're in a Transit zone so now all of a sudden single and two family zones will be allowed to have apartment buildings 100% coverage on the corners 80% on the mid blocks 1.0 F so if you've got a 5,000 foot lot you can build a 5,000 foot apartment building and the number of units is divided by that number it's called The Dwelling unit Factor the duf they want to make all of those sorry all of those dwelling unit factors the number 500 so 5,000 ided 500 is 10 units where a one family home used to be so this property could accommodate 33 units on this property 33 units no parking required okay now here's where it interfaces with the economic remember that whole thing about the corners well now I'm a developer and I say you know what I want a retail store here this new building that I'm building so I'm going to go to the City Planning Commission and ask them to put a 2500 squ foot retail store on the first floor the yellow that's what this is about this is about new buildings in low density areas to allow commercial inside of them in the middle of residential communities period similarly another one campus commercial they put a picture of a Nicha housing there and they tried to sell it that this was for public housing it's not it would be allowed on 1.5 Acres or more in any residential Zone that may not be an issue in this community board but I guarantee you it's an issue throughout the city particularly in board 11 and 13 and queens rockaways Staten Island the Bronx Etc any property that's 1.5 Acres or more and that could be split between a Street it could have uh uh multiple Parcels in the same ownership they'd be allowed 15,000 square fet of commercial 15,000 square feet of commercial okay same thing only the City Planning Commission would have to do that so just briefly this is Bayside how many of you know Bayside so this is Bell and Northern these are the commercial areas on Bell and Northern just west of bell is an area called Bayside Mana it's a little apartment complex a garden apartment complex classic classic Garden Apartment Complex see all that Garden yeah that's that's overrated Green Space not needed so what they would do is you would look at this area the areas in yellow are the gardens that are there the current zoning only allows a building that's 33 ft tall most of the property is already at their maximum build down Okay so this property right here you can't really see it here because it's light but under the basic zoning the building would be allowed to be 12T higher than it already is and they would bump up the F the floor area ratios now you've got a 40 foot high building 45 foot high building if you're in a Transit Zone which it is it goes to a 1.5 so now you've got a bulky 45t building and if you're on the new campus infill which this is now your building goes to 55 ft tall with a 1.5 and now you can put in 15,000 ft of commercial at the first okay and other buildings on the same property as I said city of yes infil and proposal number 15 will take the garden out of Garden Apartments okay so let's briefly look at Forest Hills your [Music] neighborhood this is the southern part of Forest Hills you have some sub areas you have Forest Hills Gardens obviously the Vancourt neighborhood which is what we're sitting in right now okay there's the gardens in Orange there's V court and your zoning and this is the zoning that Claudia and other people in the community worked so hard to get R2 that's your single family zone why was Vancourt made R2 because it's almost entirely single family homes on 40 by 100 or larger and by having the zoning there it made easier for the community to not have to go and enforce the deed restrictions that are there just like Forest Hills Gardens which has its own private deed restrictions right so they were matching the zoning to the deed restrictions to to a a large degree so that you don't have to go to court all the time and spend money okay r3a one and two family zoning detached r3x one and two family zoning detached r4b who lives in the tor hous the tutors between uh Yellowstone and uh 68th Avenue area in green the the row houses okay I see something okay so that's r4b that's the ones that make sure that you have the rear parking the alleys with the green space in front to stop people from Paving over that green space okay and R3 D1 which is semi attached one and two families and R32 and R4 which are low density multif family [Music] zoning so again that's just calling out forestal Gardens and and and so the yellow is your one family the Orange is your two family and the red is your low density multif [Music] family all of the one and two family would become three family plus just as the Baseline and the multif family will remain multif family see those darker areas that's your Transit Zone the entire about 60% of your area is in the transit Zone that means they can build an apartment building there again those are your de restricted areas call out the street there please sorry out the street there uh basically where we're standing is the southern end of it and it goes all the way up to the railroad tracks all the way from uh Union Turnpike to uh the railroad cut on this side you where they want to build the Queens Way right so it's everything this is metropolitan area Avenue down here that's Metro uh Metropolitan Avenue down so it's basically 80% of the area north of Metro is in the transit Zone those red streets that's 71st Avenue ascan Union Turnpike Yellowstone those are your wide streets which means every property can have an apartment building up does that mean even in the gardens [Music] absolutely they are we're going to talk about that so that's the transit Zone let me show you your existing commercial overlays Metropolitan Avenue little bit on Yellowstone Boulevard Etc here's an example of what would happen if proposal number 16 happens that's all the parcels where a 2500 square foot retail commercial storefront office could go okay and then the Town Center zoning so again accessory dwelling units Transit Zone Town Center zoning is zoning where they would allow up to four stories of apartments above a commercial strip on every commercial strip in an R1 through R5 zone so Metropolitan Avenue you have mostly on Metro you have one and two story buildings right so that would be an area where you'd have perhaps up to five stories on those blogs four to five stories and I I give an example here this is uh the uh German restaurant on Yellowstone so this is just gives you an idea of what could happen that's a fairly accurate representation I'm not an architect but that's the massing and with no Park no parking no parking required where the Shamar was where the where the Shamar was you got it so you know I I like to tailor these a little bit to your own community so you can see a little bit of what I've done this for this is like my 83rd presentation in the last six months so but I wanted to show you something you can see every day and go oh my God they could build that here right and that would be as of right as of right so you know one of the things that everybody should know and by the way this is the transit this is the old Transit zone map from six months ago when they first came out with this for community board sixs that's the new map so half of Rego Park most of the crescent and this whole area Forest Hills and then on the other side the cord Meer section all in the transit Zone me I can never ignore your part um just wanted to show you that I want to show you something else if that's okay you see this map the darker the blue the higher the home ownership rate okay queens and Staten Island Southern Brooklyn and the north and east Bronx we are the owner occupied communities of New York City New York City is onethird owner occupied but the vast majority of it is in our communities mostly one and two family communities co-ops and condos as well this is the focus of the city of yes we are the target the target is on our backs it is to get rid of owner occupied neighborhoods and replace them with market rate rental housing nothing affordable about this city planning confirmed this multiple times and they did it again last Wednesday when people said so if I build an Adu in my backyard that's not affordable nope if I build an apartment building a Transit Zone that's not affordable nope they have affordability in the high density areas but all it is is a 20% bonus on what they're already building it's nothing spectacular the low density zoning is meant to be densified that is the goal and replace owner occupied housing with rental units okay we also happen to pay 300 to 400% property tax rates than the richest parts of the city of New York yes Greenpoint in Williamsburg Brownstone Brooklyn Manhattan we're paying 300 to 400% property taxes I didn't know this any of this until six months ago the property taxes in the city of New York which make up about 40% of the budget single family homes pay the largest portion of them single family homes they want to destroy single family homes and yet we are the cash cow for the City of New York so one of the things that we have done is based upon this we don't have too many options option number one we got 26 votes on the city council we have 51 council members we have 26 votes and we killed the city of yes great and we live to fight another day 26 votes yes we sit back and accept Our Fate because once it's done it's over in that case maybe we sell our homes and move I don't know where to but either we take it or we leave and the fourth is a bill called assembly Bill 9417 and this bill would allow any Community who is not happy with this situation is not happy in general with what's going on here in the city which is a whole another issue but if you don't want this and we can't stop it this might be our only Escape without moving and that is a bill that would allow a place like farest Hills to remove itself from the rest of the city and this is actually aimed Statewide this is not just for here it's no it's not Staten Island I want to explain this to you Staten Island was we're going to take the county and become our own County that's not what this is this would allow any Community with 2,000 people or more anywhere to create their own town and that's different because one thing you got to think about is how many people live in Forest Hills in your section of Forest Hill any idea guys it's uh no no between here here we go it's number seven 11 uh 28915 people so let's call it let's call it even 30,000 okay you have 11,000 housing units and you're 61% owner occupied which is by the way the national average is about 63% so you're right there Citywide average 33% any area now remember our communities are floating the city right we are not we are not um net takers of tax money we are net givers everybody talks about how New York state is always giving you know they're getting back 37 cents on the dollar that they give to the federal government well our communities are in a similar situation right I have actually done my homework I looked because occasionally we get Skeptics I've looked at places like Rockville Center Garden City Valley Stream Port Washington comparable places to hear to Whit Stone to St alond similar kinds of Economics we are paying paying more per square foot in taxes than they are way more everybody oh Nassau County is so expensive yeah if you move to s's point but when you actually look at the numbers it's not that bad in addition if we leave the city we don't pay New York City Pro we don't pay New York City income tax I don't know how many people here do but I sure do so again desperate times call for desperate measures this is not something I was never thinking about 6 months ago but the city is backing our communities into a corn and we have to do something we either have to stop this madness from happening or we have to take Serious action all of these people right now and I'm nonpartisan okay I'm not saying this for one person or another the assembly and the Senators are all running for re-election right now and as soon as this is done whether it's up or down city of yes the council members the mayor the public Advocate and the control they're all running for re-election as soon as this is over so it's really important to be engaged and again hey you may be one of these people who thinks it's a great idea I don't know I'm just giving you the information how many people think this is a good idea you think it's a good idea okay anybody else who doesn't think this is a good idea sorry you're out voted sir um my point is there are people who are going to think this is a good idea they're going to make a lot of money on this but the misery that the rest of us are going to have to deal with is unbearable so at that I open it up to questions Miss um could you talk a little bit about the private communities like for absolutely if I can have a sip of water first I've been talking non-stop for about 40 minutes and also yes um the explosion in how will it change our sanation needs school needss let me let me start with the first question the second question first so the question was how will this increased density affect our sewer water infrastructure uh police fire schools you name it the answer is it will affect it horribly and the other statement is know where are not getting anything in fact in their document which I have right here this is their own document if I can find it here hold on here we go in the very end of the document they say something very interesting conclusion environmental review they are actually not analyzing anything that they're doing here which is shocking to me I'm a planner the first rule of planning is and again anybody who went through resoning like Claudia knows you gather the data you analyze it you have your goals and you see if the data meets the goals and then you make a decision there is no analysis of data they are coming up with 15 theoretical models and they are plugging every neighborhood into those theoretical models that's all they're doing and they admitted as such at the community board meeting last Wednesday Proto representative neighborhoods selected as quote prototypical for a neighborhood scale analysis to analyze Collective effects of the proposal for density related technical areas now I've already studied Q Gardens Jamaica States Laurelton and douston and littleneck and R and I can tell you that their laughable response they're stating that this proposal will only generate less than one unit per acre over 15 years this is an impossibility a range between 58,000 and 109,000 units in 15 years now the mayor has said over and over just a little little more housing in every neighborhood that's his little jingle right 100,000 units divided by 59 Community boards which is what we have 1,700 units per community board divided by 15 is 120 units per year per community board we don't need a zoning change for that the zoning we have today if we never touched it again believe it or not could accommodate another 8 to 12 million people it is extremely flexible as it is today so these numbers are garbage they are totally bogus okay I looked at Jano States I looked at what they proposed and I plugged in everything and I did an analysis of every property it's a 500% increase in units and that's just for one small neighborhood same with laurelon same with Q Gardens same with douglason LC and even Ridgewood which you think is a pretty dense neighborhood it's like a 350% increase in Richwood so this these this data is is nonsense and when you're doing an environmental review you have all of these different things things that you're supposed to look at they're saying that there will be no impact on land use zoning public policy socioeconomic conditions Water and Sewer infrastructure solid waste and sanitation energy greenhouse gases and climate change air quality public health and most importantly neighborhood character there will be no effect on neighborhood character okay so I I think you see we are in a fantasy world of planning because this isn't a plan this is a deconstruction of planning but they hold the levers of power so as I said you only have a few options onto how to act now the second part of your question I represent numerous deed restricted communities in New York City I represent Broadway flushing homeowners basa Gables I've worked with doublas Manor West Morland these are all the Rickard Finley communities in Northeast Queen and I've had meetings with the fars Gardens recently I actually brought them to speed on this and the statement I make is this deed restrictions are great as long as you can enforce them and to enforce them it costs money and when the zoning doesn't match the deed restrictions that much you're going to be spending a lot of money on lawsuits now some areas are more well healed than others some are one lawsuit away from falling apart others can can probably survive a number of lawsuits but at the end of the day developers have really deep pockets they can make litigation go on for years and again I've never lost a case ever I'm not a lawyer but I I I've I've been involved in over a dozen deed restriction cases never lost a case but they cost a lot of money a lot of money do you guys know the Q Forest neighborhood do you know do any of you remember the battle that happened there 25 years ago not the new building going on the back there that area the reason there are still single family homes there it was zoned to R six and in 1998 a developer bought a 50 by 100 Corner property sorry white no no no no not that one not on Austin Street no this was on Q Gardens Lane he bought a house 50 by 100 and filed plans for seven story apartment building that was allowed under the r six and I said to this community that I met 25 more than 25 years ago I said you know I think you guys have deed restrictions and they did the research they found all the deed restrictions for all 65 homes they went to court got a temporary restraining order the developers kept working threatened to kill them and then the Buildings Department refused to stop them and then the sheriff showed up and the sheriff said if you don't leave that site in 5 minutes you're all arrested and I'm taking seizing all of your Construction equipment and 3 years later not only did the community win and enforce those deed restrictions but the order was to remove the foundation and rebuild a single family home and then the city rezoned those 63 houses R2 it was an incredible case okay that in 1998 cost $260,000 that was 26 years ago W I'm saying it's not impossible but it costs a lot of money so that's my answer to you Miss questions sir possessively they're proposing this because they need housing or so they say so they say so they say yet on the other hand you you have people fleeing New York in droves correct 300,000 people I think it was were families left in the last 600,000 600,000 so how do you square the fact that they're doing this because they need more housing and people can't get out fast enough you don't logic is not in play here so at this meeting last Wednesday and I don't know if any everybody heard the the gentleman's question I'll just repeat it very quickly he said given the fact that there the city is saying we need housing and this is the drum beat that's been going on now for three and a half years we need housing we need housing and yet lots of people have left the city 600,000 people in The Last 5 Years you know how did they justify this so at this community board meeting the question came up why are why do we need all this housing and what did they do they gave census information from 2010 to 2020 they did not look at this the the the numbers from 2020 to 2024 which is the reality of the situation right as I said they're picking and choosing their data they're making all sorts of propaganda and rhetorical statements does anybody know why the
