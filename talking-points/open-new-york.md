# Universal Affordability Preference (“UAP”):

- What it is: Extra floor area that a property owner can take advantage of only for permanent affordable housing.
- Points in its favor:
  - New affordable housing would be permanent
  - Both mixed-income and 100% affordable buildings will be able to take advantage of this new zoning - making them more efficient and easier to finance.
  - The only buildings that won't have access to this extra floor area are 100% market rate.
  - Would replace and expand upon other existing “voluntary inclusionary housing” programs, which are complicated and not widespread.
  - Getting deeply affordable housing in new developments is our priority. A little bit denser buildings - and not necessarily even taller buildings - is well worth it to get this new housing.
    -Summary: UAP will be a great step forward in bringing more housing, and especially more affordable housing, to our community.

# Lifting Parking Minimums

- What it is: No longer requiring new housing to include expensive parking spaces if the owners don't think their tenants or buyers want them.
- Points in favor:
  - Allows parking to be right-sized for each development, which will reduce the cost of building new housing.
  - Building parking is incredibly expensive: $67,500 on average - and up to as much as $150,000 per spot.
  - This cost is passed on to renters and owners, many of whom don't want a space.
  - Developers already make their designs sub-optimal (e.g. building 9 units instead of 10, in order to avoid triggering current parking mandates), directly causing reductions in our new supply.
  - The burdensome cost of creating parking renders some new developments - particularly small, inexpensive apartment buildings - completely infeasible.
  - Car-dependency and parking construction contribute greatly to our climate crisis. In New York, transportation makes up 29% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than any other category, and personal car usage is more than half of that.
  - Cities across the country with much weaker public transit systems have already removed parking mandates - NYC needs to catch up.
  - This proposal will not restrict the creation of parking spaces, it simply will not require the construction of parking. There will still be cases where parking will be built based on the needs of the community.
  - For too long we've required construction of garages that encourage tenants to have cars and add to traffic and congestion.
  - And because so many other cities are ahead of New York, we have examples of rents falling where parking mandates have been eliminated. For example, after Minneapolis relaxed parking minimums, rents for studio apartments fell by more than $200 per month.
- Summary: NYC's current parking mandates are outdated, expensive, and unnecessary. The “City of Yes” proposal to get rid of them is a great step forward. It will allow a lot more housing to be built without even changing the size of new buildings.

# Transit-Oriented Development (“TOD”)

- What it is: Allowing small apartment buildings in low-density areas, IF:
  - The property is near a subway or Metro-North / LIRR station;
  - On a relatively large lot (>5,000 sq. feet); and
  - On a corner or a wide street.
- Points in its favor:
  - Apartment buildings near transit is the best kind of new development - it creates sustainable and walkable communities, encourages transit ridership, and reduces the demand for car ownership and associated traffic from driving.
  - Encouraging small apartment buildings in low-density areas is obvious - we used to build buildings like this everywhere in New York City, but restrictive zoning makes them illegal in so many parts of our community.
  - Think of X or Y - should these buildings be illegal? Of course not.
  - If you can, identify a couple small, older apartment buildings in your community before testifying - 4 or 5 stories, 10-20 apartments (see here for examples).
  - There are examples of these 3, 4, and 5-story buildings in every single neighborhood in New York City. There is nothing out of context or out of scale about these buildings.
  - If we can't build 4-story apartment buildings close to subway stations in New York City, we all might as well give up - this is the most obvious kind of housing that we should be encouraging in NYC.
- Summary: Bringing back small apartments near the train stations in our community is the perfect way of fixing our housing crisis.

# “Town Center” Zoning

- What it is: Allow better, mixed-use buildings on commercial corridors, so underutilized 1-story buildings can be expanded with housing on top.
- Points in its favor:
  - Decades of bad policies have discouraged the development of vibrant, mixed-use commercial strips.
  - Instead, we've encouraged big box stores with huge parking lots and no housing involved.
  - This proposal will support small businesses, by making it easier for customers (and employees!) to live within walking distance of stores and offices - making real, 24/7 communities across the boroughs.
  - Reduces traffic and improves safety.
  - Think of X or Y - should these buildings be illegal? Of course not.
  - If you can, identify a couple older mixed-use buildings in your community before testifying - 4 or 5 stories with a great small business on the ground floor (see here for examples).
  - Our existing small businesses are threatened by decreased foot traffic in their communities. The most important thing for them is to bring in residents who will be a short, walkable distance from their stores.
- Summary: “Town center” zoning will make our commercial corridors [NAME SPECIFIC STREET(S)] stronger and more vibrant, allowing more people to live in a great, walkable community.

# Accessory Dwelling Units (“ADUs”)

- What it is: Allowing 1- and 2-family properties to add a backyard cottage or convert a garage to accommodate a bigger family or earn extra income from an additional rental.
- Points in its favor:
  - Allows homeowners to maximize the value of their property
  - Allows families to live closer to one another by providing “granny flats” for aging relatives
  - Opens up homeownership opportunities by providing a source of revenue to help cover mortgage and property tax payments
  - Allows for the responsible addition of new housing in lower density neighborhoods
- Summary: Cities and states across the country have allowed ADUs with widespread success. It is time for NYC to do the same.

# Office-to-Residential

- What it is: Allow office-to-residential conversions in office buildings built before 1991 across the city.
- Points in its favor:
  - Create more active, vibrant neighborhoods, helping small businesses who have been hurt by reduced office foot traffic.
  - Current rules are arbitrary in terms of where offices can be converted and when the buildings were built.
  - The State included a program in the budget to pay for affordable housing in office-to-residential conversions. The City needs to pass these zoning changes so we can take advantage of these benefits and get new affordable housing in our community.
  - The State just passed a new tax exemption to encourage office-to-residential conversions, which has a strong affordability incentive in it.
- Summary: Simplifying the office conversion rules and allowing new housing across the city where it makes sense is a great step forward.

# Shared Housing (aka “Single-Room Occupancy” [SROs])

- What it is: Bringing back apartments with shared kitchens and bathrooms, so we can have more options for New Yorkers with different needs.
- Points in its favor:
  - NYC (and many other cities) made shared facilities illegal in the 1960s, hoping that it would push out low-income people who could only afford these types of apartments.
  - Obviously that was immoral and stupid - we ended up with a homelessness crisis and rising costs for everyone.
  - This change will fix the bad decisions that NYC and many other cities made in the 1970s, banning SROs unnecessarily and cutting off low-cost housing options for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers.
  - It creates more options, so single people can split up roommate shares in big apartments and free up more 2, 3, and 4-bedroom options for larger families.
  - Building SROs also creates a much needed step between shelter and long-term apartments and creates opportunities to quickly move individuals out of shelters until more permanent long-term housing becomes available.
  - Building a lot of smaller units quickly will help us meet the current demand for and prices will fall.
- Summary: Allowing more options for seniors, students, singles, etc. is the right thing to do and will help address our housing and homelessness crises.
